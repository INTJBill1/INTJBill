I found the following position advertised on a website and it perked my interest:

> Job Title: Caretaker
>
> The Arboretum is hiring for a Caretaker position. We seek a responsible individual to perform evening building and grounds security checks during non-business hours.  
>
> Housing for 1 person is provided. The Arboretum has a one bedroom studio in our main building. Housing is $75 month, including utilities except telephone service.
>
> The ideal candidate would be:
>
> A good communicator, s/he lets staff know of issues, concerns, needs, wants, etc. relating to the position
>
> Be on site at least 26 nights per month.
>
> Be comfortable in a remote location, darkness, and solitude.
>
> Understand the mission of the Arboretum.

I thought it would provide me a great opportunity for some quiet time to work on my book writing (seriously!). The place closes in December and reopens in April. Flagstaff receives a good deal of snow from what I hear and it would not be too extreme to think that I could be snowed in from the world for a time since the only access is a four mile long, dirt road through a remote area of pine.

As I took the lonely drive, I could not help but hear the main theme of "The Shining" play in my head. I welcomed this opportunity and felt it fit me better than most of the populace. The place did have a Colorado feel to it.

(REDRUM! REDRUM!)

But, GREAT ALAS, as I inquired further, the position was just filled and the applicant was moving in that same day. Egad! And I can wield a mean axe too!

HEERRRRRRE'S BILLY!
