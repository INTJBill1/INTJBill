After a time away, I am back blogging again. On Monday, I flew in from Memphis into Flagstaff by way of Phoenix to wrap up the time I spent with Nic and Alison down in Savannah. I would use this as an opportune time to unfold those activities, but I am working on a new section of my website entitled "travel â€˜04" to house pictures and info regarding that time. It will also contain my Europe journal, Cornerstone, and Flagstaff materials. The journal of my Europe travels has been a great task for me to undertake.

So yes, the WorldofBill.com is undergoing a facelift! With the addition of the travel section, I have also made a reading list. I was inspired by Ron Martoia, a pastor from Michigan, which is another fruit from Catalyst '03 for me. I am an avid reader of nonfiction material and I am seeking a way to document the volumes I run across. Considering that I picked up a Flagstaff library card today, I figure that now is a fresh start to embark on such an endeavor.

I currently find myself under a HUGE spiritual attack that nearly knocked me out of the game. I will not go into the particulars, but I do ask for my fellow followers of the Way to call out to Him. My book upon God is its infantile stage of writing and I suspect this is an attempt by the Enemy to thwart the efforts.

Of late, I have been listening to a song by Thousand Foot Krutch entitled "This is a Call." It has powerful lyrics. Feel free to hear the complete song stream at [http://www.thousandfootkrutch.com](http://www.thousandfootkrutch.com)

Unfortunately, I did not take the opportunity to see them at Cornerstone.

In other areas, although I am 1300+ miles away from Memphis, I continue to listen to Highpoint's along with the Loop's messages that are available online. I have also been trying to maintain a few connections with those in Memphis, but I fear that my friends will fade into the past with those others that were once held closely by me. From a meta-perspective, there shall come a day when we will bond again.

Tomorrow, I am planning to see if I can nail down a simple job somewhere that will not interfere with my writing.
