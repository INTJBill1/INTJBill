Stardate 46424.1 The Enterprise is on a routine scan of a nebula cluster in the Angolas sector.... whoa, wrong persona !

I find myself in the afternoon of another Monday, a day which I find myself as GBC's IT department in the flesh. Today marks the beginning of my eighth week at GBC. I have done well in the IT director's absence last week, but as the Lone Ranger for a relatively large user base for one to handle, there are a wide array of issues that have the potential to arise and I know I cannot meet all of them (ie phone system issues).

Upon other matters, I was able to lose 16 pounds in six days of last week which leaves me with only 55 more to cut by Halloween. One would think there would be a noticeable difference between 241 and 225, but I think I still have everyone fooled at work when I shaved off my 5 month old goatee. I had one user today who when I went down to see him, asked me if he could help me and then when I inquired concerning the issue, he began explaining it by saying what he "... had told Bill over the phone." He was clueless that "Bill" was standing two feet away from him.
