Friday: Closure to another week of work and the end of my second week of being away from home. It has yet to feel "real" that I have moved away from home. Rather, it feels though it's one extremely long day and I am hanging out with my friends off and on, or, it feels like the great time I had down in Denton/Dallas on the trip for our ministry to check out the Cup with Nic, Jason West, and Gary.

Regardless, I think it's safe to say that it both "is" and "feels" to be a temporary situation. Considering the time of the lease, what is a year? True, many things have transpired in my life since a year ago, but it only feels as though a few months have passed since September 13, 2001. It is much too early to say if I'll stay living in the house with the guys after a year which will most likely have roommate dynamics and finances as the deciding factors.

Upon less weightier yet more crucial matters, I should have broadband access to the Net installed this Monday. It has been an arduous time for me at the house without access to the Internet. For someone who thinks he should have information system implants integrated with his body, not having Internet access at home can display the symptoms of anxiety attacks with a pounding heart, trouble breathing, dizziness, and feeling like I'm about to die. =)
