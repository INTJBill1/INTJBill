In my continual pursuit of observing life, I find we all have personas that we apply in particular group settings and although it can be a "fantasy of personality" at what point does it indeed become "reality", or at least reality as much as one can interpret for himself?

We are creatures of a repetitious nature and I wonder if our habits are molded by those repetitions and our habits influence who we are. For example upon a small scale, I have one double door metal cabinet which requires me each morning to give it a swift kick to close it. Though my intentions were only to give that cabinet in particular a kick each time to shut it, I find myself doing the same to my other cabinet at home along with my inventory cabinet at work. Do I now approach closing cabinet doors more aggressively? It seems as though the general trend has been for me to kick every one I see shut, though they shut fine under their own ability. I have to consciously think not to kick the doors into place.

So if we pursue various habits, does the external mold the internal? Do we let our environment mold who we are? What are we then, nothing much more than a walking representation of the places we have been, influenced by what we want to retain from the perspective we held?
