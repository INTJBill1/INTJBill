Ahh... the emotional flux in which we all find ourselves amidst. There are moments when all of the world is in your pocket and you're whistling some merry ol' tune, perhaps the theme to the Andy Griffith Show, and you're content with being content.

Yet, there are darker moments when from pocket to shoulder the world thunders with an intensifying weight which allows little room for the next gasp of air.

To an extent, it is an issue of one's attitude, the perspective he decides for himself what side he will take. One's attitude, his temperament, is not something which comes from external prodding into one's being. Yes, the external can be quite influential upon us, but we are the ones who choose how we handle a situation, for better, or for the more easily choice that leads to worse.

Applying this to the realm of my own, I understand that if I allow certain events to shape me to my own detriment, then I am already beaten. I should shape the events around me, not allow the inverse.

Yet, how easy is it to grasp for the Dark Side.
