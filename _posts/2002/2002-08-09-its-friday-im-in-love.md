Friday. The close of another week of work. The oasis of another weekend swiftly approaches. Typically, I would go into how fruitless this cycle is for our lives, but I find there is no rain (for those non-poetry people out there, rain for me may be an analogy referring to thoughtful introspection, hardships, or some sort of darker mood).

It is good that this time of ease is coming for I do need time to study for my upcoming GMAT test for graduate school. I have barely studied for this $200 assessment of Bill, quite contrary to how I poured myself into studying for the Navy Pilot aptitude test (which I passed like a champ). I had a deep hunger to follow that lifestyle. Graduate school is no more than a means to an end and a dull end at that, sense it is just to chase after more money.

Where's the adventure?

For now, the weekend. It is what we strive to reach week after week. Fruitless indeed.

(Perhaps it did sprinkle).
