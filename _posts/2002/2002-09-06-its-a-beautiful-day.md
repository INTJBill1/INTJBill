Long ago, I had first heard the above song with the friends I had hung out with weekend after weekend from 18-22. The song had yet to be released as a single, yet it impacted me significantly. Time would pass and there would be reasons for me to leave those guys and that lifestyle in particular. Upon another time, the love of my life would break away from me and during those months of resolution, I would hear those words of U2 again, as a call to freedom.

I find myself at another waypoint in my life and the familiar tune plays again. It is a different time for me, yet, so very similar to those times of ago. This upcoming weekend will mark the first week that I have lived away from home, which is a significant mark considering I did not jump the bandwagon with everyone else during that late teens, early 20's era. John and Nic have been great roommates, friends, and ultimately brothers to me. Although the Mug is on the way home from work, this past week I have been skipping it because I had a room to organize and our house is more fun. When we do wrap up our moving procedures, it should be the most technological advanced place for bachelors that I have seen (ie. multiple TV's that share the same picture of computer-generated visualizations to the music being played).

It is a new era in my life, one that requires a degree of self-reliance, but ultimately requires full reliance upon God.
