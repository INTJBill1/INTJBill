I typed out my "letter of resignation" for my volunteer work at the Ugly Mug. My last night will be Friday, August 2.

For a year now until the last few weeks, I have really enjoyed volunteering for it has been an opportunity to serve God while learning the "inner workings" of a coffeehouse.

These past few Friday nights I've lost the "love" for volunteering there and lately I've been loathing it due to the additional duties one does for closing. I think now that I work during the day on Fridays, it adds an additional burden when I work "behind-the-counter" for the five hour shift when we're open, and THEN close and find myself home around 1:30 AM.

I also think I'm affected that the Mug is increasingly separating itself from being a ministry. Although there are Mug volunteers who are actively involved in the ministry, the Mug itself is transforming into an entity that does not have ministry as its focus. As a legal individual with the acquisition of profit as its primary goal (and holding my BBA I have no issues for any business to pursue such an endeavor) I am less inclined to work for no salary.

My role as a systems consultant remains unaltered for the Venture ministry.

The free time will allow me to focus upon the possibility of a second job and pursuing graduate school.
