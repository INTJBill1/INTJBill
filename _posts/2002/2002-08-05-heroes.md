"A Hero Can Save Us, But I'm Not Going to Stand Here and Wait"
-"Hero" Chad Kroeger

Heroes. We all yearn for those who emerge and take up battle and find victory against a formidable foe, whether that opponent is an entity or an intangible.

Yet, who are our heroes? Our culture will tailor professional athletes for such a role, but the suit does not fit in reality's realm. No, the battle within the sports arena makes great analogies with the struggles in our lives, but a sports hero is a hero of fantasy.

So who are the heroes? They are the ones who see the problem, realize that there are no others who are able save the day, and take the initiative of expedient action to resolve the issue. They are independent individuals who have the ability to boldly stand against a crowd. They do not have the desire to play the role, but as the problem develops, a deep burning desire within beckons them to take up arms. For within the depth of their souls, they know that they have been developing for "such a time as this."
