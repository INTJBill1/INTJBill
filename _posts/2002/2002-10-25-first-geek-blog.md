It is the end of a relatively good week. I have been able to resolve a â€˜unique' issue at work which puzzled me for hours concerning a CPU hogging service, paid all my bills except my share of the rent which has already been accounted for with the paycheck I received today, and I had a session with a sports chiropractor who spent some time with me concerning my knee.

It appears as though I do not have a torn ACL which if this is true, the light in Bill's life is shining a bit more brightly. Apparently, it is an issue with an atrophied muscle that supports my patella. Consequently, I'm training that muscle back to its normal operating parameters.

I am looking forward to my hard-hitting training sessions of ago. Ultimately, I want to revisit my Taekwondo training. There is nothing like gliding about a room, engaging one's opponents with a lightning-quick, fierce, sparring combination focused upon your opponent's head region, and then dancing out to see what his response would entail.

For everyone who is normal out there, this is the end of my blog, but for those others in our society, I've got the below:

I FINALLY managed to set up a Win2k server box (PII 233Mhz, 224MB RAM, 12GB, 40GB, 40GB) that will act as a storage location for my Star Trek episodes, movies, an archive for programs, and my main downloading client. For a few weeks, I have been struggling with two 40 gig hard drives whose previous owner had them destined to the trash, and they nearly found their way there with me.

The two Maxtor drives (yeah, I'm a WD man) in which required the cylinder limitation jumper to be set so that my Award bios could recognize the existence of the drive, but, you guessed it, NT does not support cylinder limitation jumpers and XP Pro is a bit flaky with it which does not do well for someone who wants to strictly termserv into the box Essentially, in order to run NT, I could not use cylinder limitation, but my bios does not see the drive unless I used the limitation. Quite the quandary, yet I knew I could resolve the issue if I could find a copy of WD's EZ-Bios.

I tried the available drive software for both WD and Maxtor and both resulted in errors. Dang, new software. So, I ran a search around the Net looking for an old version of WD's EZ-Bios and wound up finding a floppy image that I could use. Score! If I had used the drives with cylinder limitation enabled, I would only have 32 GB's available on each drive as opposed to the 40 GB amount. Instead, I was able to not only have the drives work in NT but also regain the additional 16GB's!

All I have connected to the box is a power cord along with a network cable.
