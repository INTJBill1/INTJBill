The most vital battle we face in our lives is that of an internal nature. If we are able to "sync" up with ourselves, how much easier can an external foe be vanquished, yet if one cannont control from within, how can he control that which is out?

For a long time, I've waged various battles against the sinful nature that is within me and as Paul states, I do what I do not want to do. There are areas in my life in which I desire to overhaul and I am "locked and loaded" at the target of my own body in regards to my weight of 241. For someone who wrestled in his senior year of high school at the same height now but 78 lbs lighter at 163, it is a bit of a load to carry daily and it is beginning to break my body down.

Halloween is my target date to reach 170, a total of 71 lbs marked for deletion. Yes, it does present an arduous challenge for me, but I am convinced that I have both the tools and the heart to accomplish this in 16 weeks.
