I found simple pleasures in my driving through the rain this morning on my merry way to work. I would have found it to be a more enjoyable experience if I did not have to contend with the typical rush hour traffic.

Without going into the details as of yet, I am finding myself within an era of change, a time which I will fondly remember these times as another golden period of my life. Holding attributes of both the simple and the complex, life holds decisions which are simple enough at this time, but hold momentous results with the passage of time. It is a good time to be alive.

I have been searching for a place to move out and I've considered both buying a house and renting an apartment. After some thought, I've realized that just renting a house is the worse of both worlds: throwing money into a black pit of nothingness for a place which you have to upkeep yourself. Sure, the less sound restrictions are great, but for someone who does not wish to be particularly loud, it does not weigh heavily upon the decision. I have the option to move out with the same couple of guys that I have aforementioned in one of my journals, but into a three bedroom house, but I do not believe I will for I was burned the last go around, my whole house rental viewpoint, and I have a desire to live alone and be able to live beyond the confines of a 12X10 room. I am heavily considering moving into a two bedroom apartment at the 19-story Exchange Building in downtown Memphis. It would be a great opportunity to live in an aesthetically pleasing environment, a place for poets with the grand Mississippi in view along with the bridge as a gateway to the West. I weighed the option of buying a house, but I think it would be wise for me to live in an apartment for a year, as I established my vocational stability, pay off both my credit card and truck debts, and save for a sizeable down payment.
