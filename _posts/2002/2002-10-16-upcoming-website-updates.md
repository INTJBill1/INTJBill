There have been two things that have irked me with my website: no contact information and no reasonable conduit for user feedback. Initially, I had no desire to have these items on the site, yet now I would like to see if I have been perking any interest. I would also like to have the site viewable for those 640X480 users out there (the poor bumps that they are). For those of you who have been long time viewers, you should be seeing some content from my sites of old, though I'm willing to put hard cash on the table that says you won't be hearing the midi version of "Who Wants to Live Forever" playing in the background.

It's about time I start posting jpegs of me on my site. It is odd for a site of mine not to have a single picture of me.
