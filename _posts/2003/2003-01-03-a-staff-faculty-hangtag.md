It has been much too long since I have taken the time to write a blog. The new year along with the new job have kept me busy with other matters and there are many times in which I do not know if I can write with the caliber of thought that I will typically expend in a blog. Yet, the Winter shall soon turn to Spring and I do not want to neglect these moments of my life.

It is great to be back at the alma mater as a staff member. During my 5 1/4 years as a student at U of M, I spied upon the staff/faculty hangtags within cars thinking I'll never have one of those. Granted, there is so much more that I can divulge about the job, yet, I'm impressed with my hangtag. Simple? I think so. I'm paying for a spot in the new garage that I tested the concrete for back in '98.

Throughout my time as a student, I always said that one day I would get a spot in the garage... ahh, the bliss. It is a very satisfying transition to go from being an hourly employee to salary. It feels as though I've now graduated from college. It only took a year and a half longer than I expected.
