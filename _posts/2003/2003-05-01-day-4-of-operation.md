As the title displays on my last blog, I have yet to entitle the operation that I am upon for the push and implementation of positive change within multiple theaters of my life. The attitude that I would affix to the description of these is of a hell-bent linebacker. During this initial phase, I am concentrating primarily on finances (debt), physical (performance/rehab), and independence (own place to live).

Though this is only Day 4 of a long process, a process which will implement other objectives in due time, some good gains were made yesterday:

## Finance

The $1600 I sent towards my credit card debt was posted last night by the company which leaves me sub $1000. This alone is a huge victory in considering it has not been this low since my Kraft days in the spring of 2001. Irked by the business practices of this credit card company, I am transferring the remaining amount to my Discover card with at a 9.9% rate that is good until October.

I do have some medical expenses looming on the horizon for mid-May but at this time I am unsure as to what kind of blow I will take. Two days ago I stopped by the bank that financed my truck purchase and paid $533 in order to pay off the rest of the loan. This will free up $274 a month for me.

## Physical

Though I am only in the fourth day, great strides have been made on the front of the physical aspects of my existence. Day after day, I literally drench myself in my own sweat. I am feeling alert, confident, energized, and have a loss of appetite. Last night I worked on nautilus equipment to the point of collapse/exhaustion.

Despite my recovering, torn UCL in my thumb and my right patella tracking issue, I have been able to orchestrate a mighty surge of progress. Once my atrophied right quadriceps are built up, I should be able to run fluidly and this is the moment I dream upon: to run and even push deep within and turn on the jets.

Though I consider it only as a minor factor to gauge my success, I have dropped 9 lbs thus far. Dropping weight is critical to improving performance, but I am not gauging my success only in terms of weight.

## Independence

Yesterday proved to be a good day for me from the scope of finally ending the months-long, daily search for a place to live. A "target of opportunity" arose and I had to hit it. I would have preferred to hold off until June or July merely for financial reasons, but if everything works out, I will be moving in May 23 to Georgian Woods to a 1 bedroom/1 study apartment of over 900 square feet.

So why the urgency? The apartment I chose is about 4 feet away (doors facing one another) to Jeremy's place. Having him as a neighbor will hold many of the good virtues that a roommate provides while at the same time withholding the negative attributes. As an added bonus, our computer networks will be talking to one another through a wireless network so we can share files, engage in gaming, or whatever pursuits we choose.

I am looking forward to the closer drive to work (5-10 minutes) instead of the 35-55 minute drives in rush hour traffic in an at least four year old construction zone that is beginning to finally push me over the edge. In addition, Downtown is about 10 minutes away. It will be great to finally have my place which will be decorated in the style of Bill. It will be unconventional in comparison to that which I have seen in other abodes.

I was able to get a great deal: today I will pay $125 to hold the apartment for 3 weeks which is half off the normal price and also acts as the application fee and the security deposit for I can have that $125 returned to me at the end of the lease. I get to have my first month's lease for free, which is spread over the 12 month period thus making rent $596/month. The water is free and according to Jeremy concerning the utilities, "I've got a billion computers running 24/7 and it averages around $67ish."

The downside of living there is the lack of washer/dryer facilities within the apartment itself, but at the same time it gives the opportunity to stop by and see the parental folks from time to time.

Though there is much work to do in the areas of finance, physical, and independence, much has been accomplished in a mere four days.
