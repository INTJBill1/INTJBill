You know what I found a little depressing/disturbing last Wednesday? I went to do grocery shopping after work. Now, I was pretty weary on that day, weak in general and in a rather introspective mood. Well, as I grabbed a couple boxes of Ramen noodles, I heard a song of my fun, college days. Those days in which I would drive around with my top down, invigorated by the power of being fully alive with no concern for the tomorrow. The Wallflower's "6th Avenue Heartache". It was in Muzak. What in the world!? I'm already hearing this being played in grocery in delightful little chimes. Eek... those daysâ€“ those days weren't that far ago... were they? Six years have passed since 1997. Six years. A girl I've been talking to at Highpoint recently went to her 10 year high school reunion. She was a senior when I was a freshman. I like to equate life with where I was 10 years ago. I was a sophomore in high school at this time. The funny thing is, I remember that time rather clearly. I look at where I'm at in life... career, apartment, character... and I think that those times were a long time ago, and time... well time picks up its speed in its spiraling manner. So I have to choose that which matters, for much of which matters, shall soon matter none.
