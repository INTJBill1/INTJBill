I have not set aside the opportunity to update my blog for I have been writing my thoughts into other mediums and there comes a point in which it feels repetitive. For those with whom are in close contact with me, you would know that I am embarking on a dream. I shall yet to divulge the contents of this to the reader for there is one who I have yet to share this and I want to wait and give a personal account.

Dreaming big and acting upon that dream is beautiful.
