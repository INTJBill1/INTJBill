As I perused through my recent entries, I've noticed that I didn't update to whether if I was able to regain my 46,000 mp3's... do not fear for I have. Yes, through a program released by Winternals by the name of "Disk Commander", I was able to rebuild the corrupt partition table so that the lost partitions are now found. I gotta to give the props up to Jeremy for hookin' me up with this kickin' solution. Yeah, you go boy.

Upon other geek matters, I have been able to use the terminal services ability of the Windows XP installation on my main desktop system. Initially, I thought the issue had something to do with some sort of corruption that must of occurred when I yanked the system from a domain to a workgroup. As I sat here this morning, I remembered that I had changed the default port number for those services to a Van Halen album... yep, that's the one. On my lunch break I'm going to give that a whirl. I'd like to leave now, but I'm waiting for Lexmark to give me a call concerning warranty service on a duplex option on a C750 Color Laser. The issue deals with bent plastic around the power hookup. If it wasn't under warranty or my own stuff, I'd probably just cut the plastic away and snap the piece into position, but since the printer is about a week old and has onsite warranty service for a year, I might as well do it right.

I resolved another issue with my home system, and this one pertained to my music PC, or how I lovingingly refer to it, my "DJ". It was using a wireless nic, but I am unable to rely on playing mp3's over the network for the signal gets dropped from time to time. Therefore, I ran cable. I also had an issue with playing songs while remotely connected, though the sound would play if one was to logged in locally. The issue wasn't resolved by using the option of leaving the sound at the local system either. The workaround I implemented was to allow Windows XP to log in automatically and BINGO.

I've got a curious problem with my laptop that's relatively new. The system is locking up with no mouse/keyboard activity available. I'm guess its either a power management issue or a heating one. I'll investigate into it further.
