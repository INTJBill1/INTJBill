I just finished up an online test in aligning various facets of my personality with Star Wars characters. Though the test was a bit of a novelty in comparison to other tests, I think its results are creative and add a twist to the INTJ results I get in other tests:

> **Openness — Yoda**
> Very High (90 percentile-High scorers tend to be original, creative, curious, complex; Low scorers tend to be conventional, down to earth, narrow interests, uncreative.)
> This wise, philosophical, and thoughtful Jedi master challenges the establishment, encouraging his pupils to unlearn what they have learned and see the world in novel, creative ways.
> 
> **Conscientious — Admiral Ackbar**
> Very High (94 percentile- High scorers tend to be reliable, well-organized, self-disciplined, careful; Low scorers tend to be disorganized, undependable, negligent. )
> This rebel Admiral is renowned for his great powers of organization, responsibility, and administrative abilities. He is individual who can be relied upon.
> 
> **Extroversion — Wampas**
> Low (15 percentile-High scorers tend to be sociable, friendly, fun loving, talkative; Low scorers tend to be introverted, reserved, inhibited, quiet. )
> Reclusive creatures of the ice planet Hoth. They are rarely seen & generally shy, leading a solitary existence
>

In other news, I spent most of my weekend moving into my new place. Most everything is in order except for the aesthetics of my server/bed room along with setting up the infrastructure of my computing systems. I have yet to establish broadband Net service, but Jeremy has provided a wireless solution until I can get my own service in place. I'm proud of the mobile TV/Entertainment center that I have. It really was a stroke of luck. Jeremy and I were at Home Depot looking for a bathroom fixture when he spied a tool cabinet of sorts and after taking a gander, I thought I'd give it a whirl. It met in superb fashion the requirements I had for such a system.

No doubt there will be more to follow.
