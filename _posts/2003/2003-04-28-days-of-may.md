April shall soon be but a memory while May approaches me with her promises of simple days with warmth ahead. I expect that May will provide a unique transitional period for me as a springboard into the upcoming summer months along with early fall. In May alone, I will be:

1. Amidst an arduous workout program to launch me past previous fitness levels which will actually be initially implemented tonight after work
2. Paying my last truck note thereby freeing up $274 a month
3. Planning an implementing for a possible move to an apartment on June 1st
4. Further extreme reduction of debt to the point of sub $500 levels

In the summer, I will be:

1. Living on my own
2. Taking summer courses
3. Debt Free

I need to do additional work on my entrance essay to graduate school at U of M, though my heart really is not in pursuing an MBA, or even the corporate world for that matter. I only wish I knew what I should be doing and I hope I am not past the point of recovery. Did I make a mistake by deciding against pursuing Naval Aviation? Granted, yes, currently I am not physically fit for such a demanding role, but I was when I decided against it. Anyway, I can fix that in the upcoming months if it was that simple.

As of today, I have selected a couple of undergraduate courses but since I cannot register until May 12, there are no guarantees that I will be enrolled:

First Session: ENGL 3604 "Persuasive Writing"
Second Session: PSYC 3510 "Deviance/Role History"

I chose the English class for a couple of reasons. For one, I have always had a knack for writing and was even told by one of my college instructors that I should at least pursue English as a minor. On my graduate entrance exam, the GMAT, my highest scoring section was the essay component. Lastly, I did a search for all classes available in the first session from 5:30-7:30 and it was the most appealing class. The class does not fit into my plan to obtain an additional degree in Psychology, to add to my Management Information Systems one, but I have toyed with the idea of picking up a bachelor's in English. I have one more slot to add a class for the second session, but I am rather limited due to my requirement that the class must be after work.

Sometime this week I am expecting three football jerseys in the mail:

* Ray Lews #52 of the Ravens
* Zach Thomas #54 of the Dolphins
* Jevon Kearse #90 of the Titans

Two linebackers and a defensive end. It will be added to my collection of:

* Levon Kirkland #99 Steelers
* John Randle #93 Vikings
* Robert Smith #26 Vikings

LB, DE, and actually an offensive player there at HB! I guess it shows my mentality when it comes to the sports arena, rather go for the virtues of hard work on a play in shutting down an opponent as opposed to the glitz of an offense with the recognition. The jerseys will function well in upcoming training as a motivational tool.
