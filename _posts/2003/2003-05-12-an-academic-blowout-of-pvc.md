Within this era of my life, I have a 4.0 in my endeavors within the halls of academia. So perhaps it's just an A in General Psychology II– and a freshman-level class at that– but it does seem to indicate a promising voyage ahead of me in this post-undergrad season. The degree of difficulty will be sharply raised this summer with the aforementioned-mentioned, two 3000 level classes from the Psychology and English departments.

I learned a little something I wish I had known when I was an undergrad at U of M. If one is to set his classification as a "non-degree seeking" student, he is not required to be advised. I wish I had known those years ago. I always felt that most of my "advisors" knew very little about real "advising" and the entire system had infuriated me since it was inefficient administrative-laden process that was forced upon me.

I had the "opportunity" to shell out $400 this past weekend to throw a new set of tires on my truck. It's not the type of expense that I typically want to incur but the prospect of having a blowout at high speeds swayed me to make the investment. There's some sort of twisted irony with this reasoning in that I bought the tires from Firestone.

Good news: my sister and brother-in-law are going to donate their couches along with their kitchen table for my upcoming move, although the prospect of having PVC furniture did intrigue me. But I feel as though this is one of those fascinations that should not to be played out in reality. I still have some other considerations in how I may employ the use of PVC in an aesthetic setting. Upon other matters, yet somewhat related, I am looking forward to setting up a room to work on pieces of art. I wish I did not pull away from this segment of my life.
