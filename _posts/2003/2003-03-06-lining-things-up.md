Typically when I write in this venue, I find myself paranoid with the manner I choose to describe the result of the electrical pulses within my cognizance for fear of awkward language usage along with grammar issues. It is as though I am under pressure to orchestrate a grandioso paper. I've just spent the last few minutes perusing through other blogs and I was amazed how simple they can be and do not even seem to hold tight to the rules of punctuation and capitalization. But, that is not the way of Bill, for he will be under a gush of anxiety, similar to o.d.-ing on caffeine if he does not resolve these issues to result in a presentable blog.

But enough with that.

I received a call from the apartment manager of Georgian Woods yesterday and my credit check passed. I was improved. Oh, don't get me wrong, I've got great creditâ€“ just yesterday I received 3 letters from Citibank, two which were pre-approval for credit cards: the Platinum (which I already have) and the Diamond which I didn't know even existed! The last letter contained those checks that I absolutely hate seeing in the mail. I figure Citibank is really wanting me back since I've paid off over $5k since Feb and transferred the remaining $800 to my Discover Card since Citibank ticked me off.

My truck is paid off and with May's operating expenses I should have $1000 of normal expenses on my Discover Card. I do have medical expenses on the horizon and I am hurting for replacement tires for my truck.

I don't know what I'm going to do once I get married. I'm expensive enough as it is.
