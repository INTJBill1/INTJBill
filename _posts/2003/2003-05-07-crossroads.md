> We had both done the math. Kelly added it all up. She knew she had to let me go. I added it all up- knew that I had...had lost her... because I was never going to get off that island. I was going to die there, totally alone. I was going to get sick or get injured.
> 
> The only choice I had, the only thing I could control, was when and how, and where that was going to happen. And so, I made a rope, and I went up to the summit to hang myself. I had to test it, you know, of course, you know me. And the weight of the log, snapped the limb of the tree so I couldn't even kill myself the way I wanted to... I had power over nothing.

> And that's when this feeling came over me like a warm blanket. I knew, somehow, that I had to stay alive, somehow. I had to keep breathing. Even though there was no reason to hope. And all my logic said I would never see this place again. So that's what I did. I stayed alive. I kept breathing. And one day that logic was proven all wrong because that tide came in and gave me a sail.

> And now here I am. I'm back, in Memphis, talking to you. I have ice in my glass. And I've lost her all over again. And I'm so sad that I don't have Kelly. But I'm so grateful that she was with me on that island. And I know what I have to do now. Gotta keep breathing. Because tomorrow the sun will rise. Who knows what the tide could bring.

Crossroads. It is a good analogy to make to this spot in my life. I have the choice before me to choose among a few, long, dusty roads with paths that soon get lost in the horizon. The only way I know I can no longer travel, is the path behind me.

Lisa and I have been continuing to talk with one another, yet our interaction has become increasingly deteriorated to the point in which we have both been overwhelmingly frustrated. She did not know how to handle the situation between the two of us. Her heart had moved on to another man whereas mine stayed true. This vexed her at times, for she would think that she left me behind.

I made a proposal that upon my honor if she so desired I would make no strides in contacting her any more, yet if she needs help she can look for me. It was something that was quite arduous to offer for she is a part of me, yet I knew it was something I wanted to freely give to her because her life is going well and I did not want to be an obstruction to that happiness.

Last night, she called and took me up on the offer.

> I walked away and let you have your space    
> Cuz leavin' didn't hurt me near as badly    
> As the tears I saw rollin' down your face    
> And yesterday I knew just what you wanted    
> When you came walkin' up to me with him    
> So I told you that I was happy for you    
> And given the chance I'd lie again    
> Just to see you smile    
> I'd do anything    
> That you wanted me to    
> And all is said and done    
> I'd never count the cost    
> It's worth all that's lost    
> Just to see you smile
