We scurry along in our lives upon this fruitless pursuit of vanity. What shall I eat? What shall I wear? What shall I drive? What shall I use to distract from the pain of a pointless life?

Man's accolades: pointless. Man's esteemed positions: pointless. How mighty are you when you shall be forgotten soon after your death? Or worse, forgotten while you are still alive? If I garner accolades and esteem from men or if I refuse to engage this foolish game of pride, in the end, I shall be forgotten and mislabeled as a senile, old man who is seemingly "out of touch" with reality.

How great you once were, yet now pushed aside. I shall find this fate.

Why are we compelled to pursue such pointless vanities? Do we beat upon our chest and with our foolish pride, demand that the world look at us for we are great– independence from everyone and dependence on no one? Sad lives we would lead if the extent of our existence is what we find within this fallen world.

May the glory be given to God. I choose to reject the misaligned focus on acquiring wealth through a career path apart from God. I choose something infinitely greater. The world can have its empire of dirt. The great deceiver is the great salesman. How is it possible for us to be manipulated to give our lives over to a pile of dirt that soon is blown away by the breeze of time? Yet, we choose that which is worthless.

I reject man's wisdom. I reject the notion that I am independent. What falsehood has been spoken! What profits a man to work 35-40 years in a career pursuing the dollar or man's praise? He starts his career and believes that once he finds a stable position, he will be happy. Happiness is not found there, so he feels that perhaps if he remains in the position and receives promotions, that happiness will be found there. Happiness is not found there. He climbs the pinnacle of the organizational chart and– happiness is not found there. He has found that the world has lied to him. So he retires, thinking that happiness can now be found from removing himself from his career. Shall he find it there? Woe to the man who looks for contentment apart from God! Neither women nor drunken revelry shall fill his hunger.
