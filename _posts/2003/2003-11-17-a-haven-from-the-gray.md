The skies of Memphis continue to oppress the city dwellers with a plight of gray. For the past couple of weeks, a haze of gray indifference has enshrouded Memphis and it has been analogous to my emotional/spiritual temperament. It is a curious situation that I find myselfâ€“ I don't really seem to fit with most Christians and I feel as though non-Christians preconceived ideas given to them by other "Christians" can cause interference in communication with them.

Of late, my involvement with various Christian ministries has been that of a fleeting joy. I have been weighed heavily by burdens in which I do not know.

Upon more brighter realms, I have found a new coffeehouse to flesh my feelings/discoveries into a tangible means. Unfortunately, they do not have the bottomless mug of coffee of the Ugly Mug, yet I do find an ambience in which I can pen my thoughts and connect with others. With the closing of the Mug, I have found other coffee solutions to be lacking. Thus far, I have seen several of the old gang from the Mug there and even met one who works behind the counter who is INCREDIBLY COOL! (I give my props to computer geeks who are women)

As far as tech goes, today I've streamlined my site and updated a few of the links.
