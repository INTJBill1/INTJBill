This pursuit we have for wealth, to own "things" in our lives, how pointless it is indeed! We pursue that which we think will provide our own self-gratification. We waste the hours of our days with mind numbing activities of console gaming and television, television which serves to inject us with the world's agenda. Our pride, our pursuit of independence, has fattened us and we "have too much and disown (Him) and say, â€˜Who is the LORD?'"

What good is a pointless life which pursues satiating our sinful man? Vanity!

My job here at U of M seems so pointless. I walk by all the shiny Mercedes, BMW's, and Cadillac SUV's and think how all of it is SUCH rubbish! A BMW Z3 convertible was in front of me as I drove through the garage with one of those hundred dollar bill air fresheners and I thought it was all so pointless. Pretty on the outside, but death on the inside.

"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence. Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside also will be clean. Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean. In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness."

I am considering what Jesus told the rich, young ruler: "Sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me." I'm looking for opportunities from a global perspective where I can go and follow Him directly. My vision is big. My God is big. I hunger to pursue after righteousness.

I'm preparing myself for the time in which I am called.
