I find myself remotely locked out of my server. I knew that I would do it, just plain knew it. "Bill, why didn't you put the appropriate safeguards into place to prevent such an atrocity?" Oh, I had for the most part. I just got lazy with its implementation. Sure, I had the countdown till the restart of my server running, but I fooled around with a firewall's setting instead of removing the firewall's exe from startup. But in defense of myself, I did set up the software to trust my IP address so I assumed that I would be able to relogin into the box from work.

Plenty of ice to go around in Memphis. Yesterday, I was off from both work and school at U of M because of the weather. I found it to be the opportune time to watch hours of TechTV. It's a new kick of mine and this geek likes it. I also finished another season of NCAA Football 2003 for the XBOX with U of M, but I suppose I've already written more about it here than it deserves.
