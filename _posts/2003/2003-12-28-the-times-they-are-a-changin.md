Just a brief update here: tonight marks the last night that I'll have broadband access here in Midtownâ€“ assuming Time Warner doesn't try to shoot down my plans. This is the kind of thing that big, corporate conglomerates seemingly love to frustrate my planning. I have decided that I no longer require broadband access and in efforts to cut back spending, I will have free dialup access from work if need be. It should also free up additional time. Upon a line of tangency, tomorrow I will be canceling my garage access at work.

By the way, I have developed a new style of urban art. Next time you have a lighter along with a couple of credit cards, give it a whirl in combination with running water.
