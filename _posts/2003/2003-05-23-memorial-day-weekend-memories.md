If this year was 1999 or 2000, I would probably find myself driving out of Lexington, Kentucky right about now. As I drove to work this morning, the sun, the sky– even the breeze– felt like that time of long ago. I used various holidays to visit Lisa. In 2000, I saw her high school graduation one night and the next night, I saw KISS in concert at Pittsburgh (I saw Ted Nugent that night but somehow that really takes away from the point I'm trying to make; insight for the day: Ted Nugent and David Lee Roth would complement one another if they were to tour together).

So do I miss her now? You betcha. If you see her, feel free to tell her that since I can't. =) Those weekends always seemed to point to the future to the time in which the two of us would not have to traverse 750 miles to see one another. Overall, I just miss "her". There's a part of me that says we'll never see one another again, and then there's another part of me that says that I'll see her when I'm 74 and she's 71; we'll find ourselves as widowed, and then we'll hook up and pursue my elderly life's dream: grab an RV and head towards Branson, MO!

It's odd, with everyone else in my life with whom I've had romantic interest and/or dated, it was primarily based on a shallow concept of a strong physical attraction, a precept in which does not allow me to care to see them if suddenly they are in their 70's. But with Lisa it's different for I really like who she is and I would be content if we were both glowing orbs of light.

This weekend does mark another special date: I am amidst a move to my new apartment, my first time to be completely out on my own (no roommates) and though the process of moving is a bit tedious, I am looking forward to having my own place setup. I'll probably provide links to pics of the place once I have everything setup. My wireless router should be coming in via UPS today and that will be an added punch to the place. Thus far, the biggest issue I've run into is the placement of the larger couch my sister gave me. It's just too long to implement what I had initially planned to do.
