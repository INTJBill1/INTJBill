Indeed, it has been quite awhile since I have developed the opportunity to write in my blog. I have found my resources tied up with my move to Georgian Woods and since I was using Jeremy's wireless connection, it made it difficult to update my blog since without any modifications to my system I didn't have access to it and U of M blocked his IP address from any of the school's servers (though there are workarounds for that too).

Last night, the Road Runner technician installed broadband service to my place and from that point I brought my wireless network up. I am still unsure to the routers final home for currently in resides in my "Matrix room" and at this moment I would like to maintain the room devoid of nothing much more than a power cord. Upon other geek matters, I continue to have issues with my three 100 gig hard drives. Essentially, the partition tables are corrupted on each drive thereby preventing me from accessing my behemoth mp3 collection. This distresses me, though I consider it to hold the highest priority of tasks for me to resolve. The issue arose when I tried to install the drives onto a system with a motherboard that did not support drives that large so I used a software overly (EZ-BIOS) to enable them, not knowing at the time that two of them were setup as dynamic drives. I believe the overlay corrupted the dynamic aspects of the drives and somewhere along the way, the partition tables went wacky, though I'm not sure if it was caused by the initial issue or my attempts at resolving the initial issue. I do know that the third drive, the non-dynamic one, worked fine until I mistook it for one of the corrupt ones and in my attempt to resolve the issue at hand, I tossed it in the same category as the other two. On a different system, I am trying to revive a 40 gig drive that has some of its own issues in which I cannot access the data. As I type this, disk recovery software is running and hopefully when I swing by the house during my lunch break, I will make some headway. Thus far I haven't.

I heard an interesting remark this morning in my TigerLan meeting: "We cannot keep people from being stupid." I just read where Barry Manilow thought he was in a Malibu room, woke up, walked straight into a wall, broke his nose, and then lost consciousness. Hmm... I'll say nothing more.

Currently, my workout program is shot to pieces. A few weeks ago when U of M's rec center had to be pulled down for maintenance, my routine was knocked off its path and intricacies that my move to Midtown involved, I have yet been able to get back on track. With my upcoming Summer school sessions on the 9th, I will have to be implementing a new daily routine and considering I'll be getting out of class at 7:30 at night, I may have to make it a morning routine (ugh!). Oh, don't get me wrong, I've done morning routines in the past at the Bartlett Rec, but at this stage in my life, mornings are tough on a computer geek for we relish the night.

Upon other matters that are shot to pieces, my finances are out of control. I went from a mere $700 of credit card debt to over $2000. Moving and living by oneself is exceedingly expensive. But a lot of the costs I have incurred are one-time/rare expenses such as replacing my tires for $400... then there was the $180 5.8 GHz cordless phone so that the transmission would not affect the wireless networks that are in place at our apartments. I need to sit down and redefine/restructure my plans of improvement. Of course, such planning is always a dynamic process since life is full of variables that one should consider.

The life of a bachelor has been great thus far.

Lisa, if you're reading this, times like now I wish the bridge was in place so that we could talk:

> I wish for all the world that I could say...    

Another time...
