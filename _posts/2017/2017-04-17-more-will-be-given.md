He is *risen*!

Disregarded by the secularist, today marks a day of joy for the believer. For all the hub drub that is Christmas, Christ's resurrection from the dead holds greater significance, for without it, Jesus would have been just another baby born 2000 years ago; without the resurrection, everything he taught would have been a bramble of lies and ultimately worthless. And for those fools who followed him, the Bible would have been meaningless. Without his death, burial, and resurrection, I would lead a truly pathetic life of nihilism.

But *glory* be to God that he arose. It ignited a movement that continues to this day, one that I have been chosen to follow for I have been born of Spirit.

So what do I do with this knowledge? Do I coast through life, or am I compelled to do something different? Matthew 25:14-30

There is a tendency to allow the world's pressures to drag us from seeing eternity. Then there are pursuits that cunningly shift our time from God. How easier it might appear to just dig a hole in the ground to place our salvation! There forever remains on this side of the grave, a tension between the sin nature and our redeemed identities. However, we want to advance God's majesty; our heart's longing dives into the hope of being "faithful over a few things" so that he "will put (us) in charge of many things." It is not an escape, it is a full-on engagement and responsibility. How we wish to share in our God's joy!

So it is today, a day full of joy and celebration. Because he is risen, I am *alive*!
