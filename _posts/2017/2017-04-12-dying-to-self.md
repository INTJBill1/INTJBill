I have discarded my Facebook & Food fast.  It was senseless for me to cling on to an ideal.  I do not know what I was thinking, grasping into the air and grabbing nothing, longing for the friendships I once took for granted—the meaningful ones, I could look into their eyes and feel their soul.  The past has them now; as we age, we spread further apart. Digital venues only mock what we shared, for lasting friendships are neither created nor cultivated by a mouse-click.  I logged into Facebook, thoughtfully considered each person, and released them into the sea of the Great Digital Beyond.  In this age, who are we kidding?  The global village is just a Hollywood soundstage. Our lives there are little more than server logs, an endless churning of  status updates.  There is no humanity, there is no spirituality—just blank stares from the abyss.  It is entirely antithetical to our lives in the Spirit.  I clung on with white knuckles because I wanted so much more.

Philippians 3:8-21

While there is still meat for me to chew in fasting from food, it is a discipline I am reserving for another time, when my mind has disassociated it from this transition in my life.  Fasting cannot be in a place of expectations; it has to be in a place of brokenness.  Fasting has never been about the highlights of life.  Fasting is about humility and preparation.  I could use volumes of both for I am a selfish creature cast into a dark world.  I pound my chest and thunder, "Look at me! Look at the work of my own two hands!"  Yet, my only value is Christ's imputation of righteousness upon me.  When I live apart from that, when I recklessly abandon it in zealous fervor, blazing toward the gates of hell, everything else comes crashing down.  God has beautifully orchestrated this in my life, disciplining me time after time.  I am his son—though how often have I forgotten my name! I forget whose I am.  Ephesians 1:4-6 / 1 Peter 2:9-11 / 1 John 3:1-3

I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me. Whether Jesus was crucified today or this Friday 2000 years ago, whether I eat or refrain, I do so as I love Jesus and yearn for His return; I hate the things that separate me from Him.  The issues that demand the world's attention are resoundingly trivial in relation to our kinship with our heavenly Father.
