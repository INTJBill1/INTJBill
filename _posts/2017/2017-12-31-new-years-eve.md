This site is the existential tangent between my soul and the ether of the Netâ€”not that we can divorce our physicality from either space on this side of the great chasm, whether its the smelting of the one or the square-peg-meets-round-hole of the other. On the eve of 2018, I write to the future. I dream of the eve of 2019, when I can look back and see a trail with all of its wonderful idiosyncrasies and critical junctures that unfurled onto a landscape of spirited change dripping in its own vitality. May a stoic bookshelf with its reef of dust be far from me! YET...that is the fear: another year where the overarching progression is in the slow march to the grave. On the one hand, the body is served with all of the scarcity that entangles, where on the other, there is the soul that chooses between the ease of confinement and the burden of freedom.

Where does all of this leave me? The eve awaits.
