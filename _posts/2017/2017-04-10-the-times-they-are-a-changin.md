A new home for my thoughts. A solace away from the everpresent bustle of the Internetâ€”that place of "people talking without speaking, people hearing without listening."

My intention for this simple site is a three-fold approach to focus my mental energies: it (1) functions as a reservoir for when I feel that urge to write and can no longer hold back; (2) serves as a one-stop for the projects I am working on and their status; (3) provides helpful tools for others, whether built by my hands or being shaped by God. And hey, it is a place where I make myself available.

As a celebration of its kickoff, I begin a heroic journey: I am going on a Facebook & Food Fast. I see parallels between the two, how they can serve as idols in our life; I have gorged on both and felt emotionally empty afterwards. I can say I have lost friends over Facebook, and lost health over food. Life cannot be lived within the pitfalls of the intoxication of gorging consumption.

So, I take a step back to tinker with perspectives. I return to God and see Him. When I am hungry, I seek Him. When I am lonely, I call out to Him. He is the shelter for my soul.
