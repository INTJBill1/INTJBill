While earlier this year, I used Sundays as a day of rest with my 6-day regimen of training, I've decided that I'd add 16% more production to my training by adding another day.  What is the biggest risk really—burning out?  I'm so efn on fire I'm burning!

...it's purely a cardio day and as my heart and lungs never have a day off, why not?

...yeah, I'm sore, but that's par for the course.  If I'm not sore, I'm not pushing hard enough.

...as long as I spend most of my time on an elliptical, it's minimum impact.

I find watching my DVD collection of UFC fights as I train to be significantly motivational. It connects me with those years ago...

I ate an hour of cardio for breakfast and another for a late lunch.  Now it's dinner time!
