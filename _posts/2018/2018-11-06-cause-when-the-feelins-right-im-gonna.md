Two weeks from now, I'll climb atop that medical scale of mine, and see what kind of results I pulled in The 5th Expedition. It won't be close to the production of The 4th Expedition, a sixweek lb loss of 14.9%, the best out of all Expeditions.

That said, I would like to beat out The Second Expedition's 10.8%. Though the two periods dealt with different weights, I may have a shot at beating it.

For all the pavement that I've passed this year, I've got a long ride ahead. And big picture: it's just a component of what I'm trying to accomplish.

I've made an inquiry and I'll see in the next few days which fork in these woods I'll take.

I don't care "'cause when the feelin's right, I'm gonna run all night."
