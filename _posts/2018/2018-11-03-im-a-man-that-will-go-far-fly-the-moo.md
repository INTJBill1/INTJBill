Earning an accounting degree just makes sense...

First of all, I've already cleared all the gen ed requirements and most if not all of the business requirements outside of the major. I would actually be taking classes in accounting which is a shame that most of a 4-year college program is just that—but, I digress. Somebody has to pay for the classes that won't contribute to people making money after graduation—I'm looking at you, Art Appreciation. Hey, don't hide Music Appreciation! Come back here, Oral Comm— you're already in everything else!

There's literally no downside from a financial perspective. The worst case scenario is I don't find a high paying job afterward, which is exactly where I am now. Despite the dividends it pays for the kids, homeschool teaching does not not build shareholders' equity. Taking out additional student loans makes no qualitative difference to the student loans I already possess—experientially, it is identical.

There's a ton of upside from a financial upside. It could be a gamechanger: there's a lot of potential to make real money out of the gate and put me into a superior position to start my own business by the age of 50.

Yes, doing well to infuse the material into me requires hard work along the way—so does waking up early and training. The time put into it will encourage general brain development; there are those who slack after a certain age and in due time, believe Branson, MO sounds like a good time.

Yes, I'll have to handle difficult situations. What is the core of resistance training? Pushing heavy things and the recovery makes things awesome blossom. This opportunity will further develop my ability to find solutions in the interpersonal arena.

It's about developing a vision, trusting it, and carrying it out. As it has been said, "Never doubt you're the one, and you can have your dreams."

Sweep the leg, Johnny.
