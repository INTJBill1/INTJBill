My elliptical points to the east, where the morning sunrise hits me as I make my strides.  As I do, I think how the sun has just come from the Czech Republic, London and all of the places I love over there; swung down for some beach time in the Bahamas; and has stopped by my place for a visit.

In front of the cardio is my stereo receiver on a shelf with a repurposed computer display atop with two speakers behind it for my movie watching.  The 2018 UofM football schedule adorns the wall. One day, I'm sub-200lbs and there will be a power tower in there.
