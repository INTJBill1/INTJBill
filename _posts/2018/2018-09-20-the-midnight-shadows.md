...and what compels me to move forward with my nutrition & training combo is a vision of the future.

I don't know what lies ahead in the years to come—it's been a far-flung adventure leading up to now—why would I think the future would be any different?  As much as I might assume things will remain the same, they never do. I know nothing about stagnant waters.

And while I look forward to returning to an athletic physique and all the opportunity that it provides, it is the intangibles that fill my dreams at night. Yes, I'll forever be me, INTJ Bill, but the discipline and development that happens to lose over HALF of my body weight will make me an enhanced INTJ Bill.  Even now, I can easily make the extra push and accomplish more than the past average...and I still seek ways for further optimization...

It's more than running races or tacking on muscle and cutting lean.  It's about the next direction I want to take my life.  Yes, I've been a system administrator, a technical writer, an IT dept manager, an English instructor, and now a homeschool teacher, but, I don't think my phases are done yet.

And this, the vision of another reality along with everything else, drive me forward through this diet and training. Ambition compels me.  When we lose this fire, we dunk a bag Doritos over our head and let Netflix roll.
