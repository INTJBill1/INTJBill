It's a Sunday, my day of rest—in theory.  In practice, I chose to spend my first 3 hours related to cutting the grass since we're getting a large shipment of rain in this week.  I followed it up with dropping some pesticide against a large column of fireants who retaliated be sending 5 commandos atop my foot, leaving 3 welts in their response.  Thereafter, I spent some time sunbathing, something I really haven't done (purposely) since 2005.  It was surprisingly welcoming and I hope it helps this poison ivy rave I'm trying to simmer down.  I'll have to find a way to add it to my weekly regimen.

Finally, I did an hour of light-light cardio while watching the movie.  I picked up MI:III after another run at the closing video rental store.  In a span of a week, we picked up 355 titles.  It's just hard to walkaway from a 6 for $10 DVD/Blue-rays.  A lot of great movies and among them that we were able to snag was a great Christmas collection.  People don't think about Christmas in May.  Watching Christmas movies is a fun tradition for us during that month of hope and memories, but it's expensive to buy everything, so in the past we rented.  And now, we can say we have the Home Alone‘s; Ralphie and his A Christmas Story; the hijinks of Christmas Vacation; Buddy the Elf's saga; my longtime favorite, It's a Wonderful Life; and many more.
