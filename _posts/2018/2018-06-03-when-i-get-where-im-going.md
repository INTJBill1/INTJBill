When  I get to where I'm going...both not so much the Brad Paisley and Dolly Parton duet AND with that song, both as it relates to this transition I'm making to a new me AND the new me beyond glorification, I'm going to be an encouraging person.  This old world beats us down and it is by far too easy to be critical, or worse, jealous of others.  We treat our lives and each other as players in a realm of scarcity, a zero-sum game of "me, me, me." Oh, that Agent Smith!  And yes, we can manifest artificial scarcity: I need gold! I need uranium! I need McDonald's Double Quarterpounder with Cheese!

But, look: we've got a lot of sunshine out there...a lot of air to breathe...water...and with a little prep, there's food. Somewhere along the way, we fouled all of that and inserted scarcity into the system...thereby causing fear...thereby causing hate.  We're more than that, much, much more.

But, I fail.  I think how I can protect my little fiefdom, my little domain of a little king.  it's far, far too easy to snarl at each other.  It's far too easy to cling and tear down with gravity and entropy, than to lift up and build.  There are a lot of broken people out there.  By breaking you, I better me? What logic is this?

> Was all or what little pleasure exists    
> Seductively sold and uselessly mine

In the end, this tearing down of each other, whether in some silly, non-specific political anger...or a corporate ladder to nowhere nonsense...or the Hey Jealousy of bygones ago...or anything else reallyâ€”including the clothes we root for, ultimately shows a lack of self-awareness and self-confidence. It is...a scarcity mindset that corrupts our body and our soul. And I'd make a guess, that it is the symptom of an old wound that we keep picking at instead of allowing it to heal. Or just low intelligence stemming from a head being at the business end of a tack hammer.

In this whole, body transformation thing of mine, it's more than just taking a six-pack off the shelf.  It's about forging the character within as well, be the person that I want to be around, and as the Tim McGraw lyric goes, become "a friend a friend would like to have."
