It's my Wednesday break amidst my pull-push resistance routine. I like the break because it gives my arms a chance to cool down.  There's really no way to get around using my arms for an upper body workout, so they get plenty of opportunity to get their reps in...and if not, I blast them on Fridays.

I'll look back at my prior diet and think about how its was loaded with more nutrition and more protein than my current diet at 184 less calories. However, it has a drawback of maintenance (4 meals in 8 hours) and bulkage—chew, chew, chew...

My current diet excels at two critical things: only 2 meals in 8 hours—in practice its 5 hrs—AND price!  Right now before taxes, it's $3.07/day and that includes 2 cups of Starbucks coffee ($0.48).  And honestly, if it exceeds the RDA; what does it matter if its not the X-fold amounts of the other?  There's also an intangible to the second diet: the ability to transform into other meals.  The first was pretty straightforward.

As I have yet to list the ingredients to the second diet, here they are:

* Soybeans, 4.4 oz
* Green Tea, 2 cups
* Almonds, 0.8 oz
* Sunflower Seeds, 0.8 oz
* Cinnamon, 1 tsp
* Flax seeds, 3 tbsp
* coffee, 2 cups
* cheddar cheese, 3 oz
* broccoli, 5.7 oz
* eggs, 4
* olive oil 1 tbsp
* Original No Salt Alternative, 1.25 tsp (gimme some of that potassium chloride!)

s far as supplementation goes, I take a 1/4 tablet of 50mg tablet of zinc, 225mcg of iodine, and a quarter serving of Solgar's B-Complex Stress Formula—not for stress, because I'm "all right, all right, all right." I do it for B3 and to get my B6 and folate over the hump.

Of course, all of these numbers and items are subject to change.  I'd like to bump its % of calories from fat from 65% to 70%, but I have yet to find the solution without adding calories. With calories, it's a brainless exercise.
