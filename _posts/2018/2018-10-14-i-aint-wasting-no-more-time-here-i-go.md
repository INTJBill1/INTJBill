In recent days in west Tennessee, we've reached those beloved autumn temperatures. From the calendar flipping to fall up to these days into October, it has been far too hot to label it anything like autumn. But here we are, the temperatures of training. Ahh, it's more than that of course.

I really do love this month—not for its ghoulish aspects. I'm not against the macabre in of itself, either, for even before the popularity of The Walking Dead, I was a fan of the zombie genre and mowed down a lot of bad movies/books for my fix. I just loved considering its practical application and it as a societal metaphor. No, it's the specific calendar date that is in play here.

Perhaps I wear the mantle of my father's disdain for Halloween, as the first of our name, my grandfather, died on a Mississippi River barge explosion on October 30 when my dad was 12, just days before his 13th birthday. In like manner, I don't view Valentine's Day like everyone else as I buried my father on that day. Now, I don't feel the same about Easter despite my Mom dying two days after it on 2015, but it's the specific nature of the holiday's celebration of the resurrection that makes the difference.

While I do really like the concept of Día de Muertos, I celebrate Reformation Day on October 31. That's the game changer. It's not a superficially fun holiday and puts things into context, which is why its superior to Halloween. But hey, if there's an opportunity to toss a couple bags of discounted candy toward my kids way, all the more better.

Perhaps I appreciate this time the most as a bridge. Sure, sure a bridge to workout and reach my fitness goals into 2019. But, I value it more as a bridge to Thanksgiving, as that holiday is the threshold into the Christmas season. It's funny, as kids, we were always all about the surprise of the toys while hitting those landmines of gift wrapped socks. Today, who cares about presents?

From Thanksgiving leading up to New Year's Eve, it is a celebration that parallels Dickens' A Christmas Carol as I warmly consider the past, present, and future; it is as if all events merge into one space. I love the music, the decoration, and the movies. I like how the workplace takes a backseat and is no longer the chief end of man. Yes, yes there's that cloud of consumerism that mucks everything up and funnels food into that mouth-smacking marginal utility as the dribble of greed drips down a greasy face, but, that's what other folks do. For while I start thinking about The Season before retailers do, I don't have the glint of the ecstasy of gold in my eyes.

As the year wraps up in the Christmas season, my eyes look toward 2019...get your New Year's resolutions together, folks, I'm coming...
