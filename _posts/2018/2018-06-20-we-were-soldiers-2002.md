I'm pushing back my re-emergence onto Facebook a couple of weeks.  While I initially planned 22 weeks in advance, with regards to continuity, it just makes sense to have a fourth six weeks, to have The Fourth Expedition.  In practice, there's not a whole lot of difference between September 3 and the September 17.  And it gives me an additional two weeks to put some solid work in.  But, I'm under no illusion that my work will be done come autumn.  I won't even be done with the cutting phase.  I do reasonably hope to be under 200 by that time, but it depends on how Monday's weigh-in goes and how my body transitions thereafter.  I'm looking forward to The Third Expedition's diet and I expect that it will tear into the weight loss.

I'm still developing its cardio program. As much as I prefer the resistance, the focus must remain on cardio while the ol' iron is a secondary driver. Depending on the status of my feet, I wouldn't necessarily be opposed to slowly incorporating a condition program for running.  Months ago around the turn of the year, I set up a schedule that begin in July.  It still may be too early to engage it, but I don't have a problem with exploring it.

I've been enjoying my return to mindmapping.  I began using Freemind around 2004.  It's older now, but It remains the same program as it ever was and it can't be beat to capture a flurry of thoughts.
