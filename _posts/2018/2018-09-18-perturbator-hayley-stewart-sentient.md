...then there's the difference between knowing what is right and doing what is right.

Yes, I could say in those college years and coffeehouse years of 2001-2002 that I didn't posses a strong suite of nutritional information. But, I couldn't say that in 2005 into 2006.

In spring of 2005 after I turned in my bicycle for a Yukon, my lifestyle shifted. I broke my vegan life for a party-of-one affair at the Memphis Pizza Cafe that was out at Wolfchase. My comeback nights of Taekwondo became fewer and those lunch workouts were out of rhythm. There was the summer whirlwind in June when I began dating my wife and we'd marry in Vegas in August. Thereafter, my focus on nutrition and training was put aside. Not that I was conscious of it, but it was the classic example of asking to what end.

I'd still wanted to be fit, but I never really laid out a full-on strategy to get there, more of just a healthy tips approach. Through the years, I'd have the occasional jolt toward using the gyms in a box at apartment facilities in Flagstaff, the full-on resources at the University of Memphis (including walks from Georgia Woods to UofM's rec center), or the sad little space next to my office at UAS Sitka.

But, I never had a dietary & training regimen that possessed any kind of fortitude.

Honestly, I'm not sure how I got from there to here.  I've owned a FitBit—in fact, I'm on my third. I've dreamed of six-pack abs.  I think to some degree, I rode the wrong vehicle and trusted in fasting.  For example, look at my approach with it this year.  Sure, I had success, but it was a hard road to tread, and frankly, I've had better success with everything past April.

I believe I owe a lot of my success to Cronometer's web site.  While I knew of the importance of solid nutrition and years prior had read a couple books from John Robbins and another from Joel Fuhrman, I didn't know exactly what was going on.  Cronometer allowed me to know exactly what was going on.

But, it's more than calorie counting—there's not a lot of sizzle there.  It's finding an approach that is daily repeatable and sustainable which provides success.  And frankly, simple.  When things get a little hairy, I want a simple game plan that I can go to as additional complexity in a system provides more points of failure.  But again, that's not particularly compelling.

To some degree, self-actualization has to play a role into it.  Still, sometimes one just hits a streak and runs with it.  I can't explain my success other than the obvious inroads.  But the diet and nutrition is just the machinations.  It is about the deep.

## Reunited, and It Feels So Good

As I referenced in a prior blog, I've been waiting for an antenna for my Verizon Jetpack and BAM it works.  I've got a spot that somehow I pulled 4 bars—which makes little sense considering I've consistently only got 1-2 bars with my iPhone in the best places against the windows of my house.  More specifically, it looks like the best spot I found thus far is a RSRP of -95 with a SNR that kicks up to 20.  And hey, I don't have a device hanging out in a window needing a cooling fan, so that's all win.
