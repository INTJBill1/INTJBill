Instead of breaking out in song with this one, just read it as a poem:

> Rock of Ages, cleft for me,    
> Let me hide myself in Thee;    
> Let the water and the blood,    
> From Thy wounded side which flowed,    
> Be of sin the double cure,    
> Save from wrath and make me pure.    
> 
> Not the labor of my hands    
> Can fulfill Thy law's demands;    
> Could my zeal no respite know,    
> Could my tears forever flow,    
> All for sin could not atone;    
> Thou must save, and Thou alone.    
> 
> Nothing in my hand I bring,    
> Simply to Thy cross I cling;    
> Naked, come to Thee for dress;    
> Helpless, look to Thee for grace;    
> Foul, I to the fountain fly;    
> Wash me, Savior, or I die.    
> 
> While I draw this fleeting breath,    
> When my eyes shall close in death,    
> When I rise to worlds unknown,    
> And behold Thee on Thy throne,    
> Rock of Ages, cleft for me,    
> Let me hide myself in Thee.    

At age 23, Toplady wrote this hymn five years after becoming a Calvinist from Arminianism. While I was on my own spiritual journey at 23 in 2001, I can't say I had yet actualized the depths of the knowledge regarding the sovereignty of God as seems apparent in this piece. I was stubborn; I specifically remember knowing that we were dead in our trespasses—how did I reconcile the fact that dead men can't obey? CAN'T RESPOND—DEAD. There's no possibility of choosing Jesus anymore than it is possible for a man in his casket to climb out and leave his funeral to catch a Patriots game! And honestly, it's not like we're in a neutral position: without the Holy Spirit's regeneration of our soul, we actually are hostile toward God:

> For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God's law; indeed, it cannot. Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.

Who knows how many times, I read this:

> And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience— among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind.
> 
> But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved— and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.

Or check this out:

> For we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, slaves to various passions and pleasures, passing our days in malice and envy, hated by others and hating one another.
> 
> But when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that being justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.

Anyway, I think you get the point I'm trying to make, even if like me, it would take you decades to get there. To some extent, it has to do with exposure. I never even heard of the Doctrines of Grace until I was 23-years-old and went to a theology-driven Bible study taught by a seminary student. I still remember where I was sitting on a couch in a house on Kearney Ave in Memphis, a teaching easel of paper in front of me. I bristled against it as the initial shock like a punch in the face dissipated. Today, I'm grateful that it was revealed to me, though I wish I was around teachers who could have taught it to me sooner. Maybe I would have incurred far less growing pains!
