It's Friday!  Of course, I've changed my training so that it no longer marks the end of resistance training. Still, nevertheless, I refill my vitamin dispenser!

I'm at the end of my Tom Cruise action foray as I believe my DVD/Blu-Ray collection is now tapped out.  He's a great actor to watch because he just runs so much. I haven't seen The Last Samurai since June 2004; it was on a flight back from my first backpacking trip across Europe. On the same media center that I listened to Hootie and the Blowfish's cover of Goodbye Girl, I  watched the movie on the back of the seat ahead of me. I was bored with it, but I'm sure it was the context of where I was in my life at the time, upon my own adventure throughout that year.  This time around, some 14 years later, I found the movie to be entertaining while I churn out the sweat on my elliptical.

I'm highly considering making a shift to a minimum of 3 hours of cardio, Mo-Sa.  It's not particularly hard to do.  I made a change to my alarm to 3:50AM to ensure that I'm not wasting my time in setup, so that I can straight up 4-6AM. I then can hit 30min midday and another 30min at the end.  Of course, I said "minimum," and I fully expect to do more.  It's experimental, but I've been sliding exercises into my day.  For example, as I make the kids oatmeal in the morning, I slip in 20-rep sets of twisting crunches on an exercise ball.

I have a little over 30 days until I weigh-in for the end of the Second Expedition.  I fully intend to blow the First Expedition's results out of the water, despite the First's advantages.
