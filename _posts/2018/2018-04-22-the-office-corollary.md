I write this from atop a 75cm high exercise ball. I can see how it will strengthen my core and will give me a nice, deep middle/horse stance. But, I have to manage the need to bounce as that gives me a nice spoonful of motion sickness as I type. It also compels me to wear these old glasses from my time in Alaska. I never wear them and that's why this prescription is five years old. I live through most of life fine with astigmatism. Most things look better with a slight fantasy blur, right?! I live in an epic! Where's my tunnel into the adventure of a dark forest? But, it's not a big deal—I never squint or anything and don't really notice it sans when I need to thread a needle. And c'mon, I'm a Smith not a Taylor. I pick up molten metal!

As I hoped, today has been a REST day! (well, if you don't count this thing under me) My alarm went off and I actively chose not to get up. It wasn't one of those things where I was lazy—my body needs to heal up and again, there's nothing like losing weight and building muscle like doing it asleep. Plus, I REALLY want my foot to return to normalcy in time for Monday's cardio. But as I awoke at 6, my body was yelling at me to workout. But, there will be PLENTY of that this week...

As I've recently written, I've made a few Amazon purchases of late—including the complete 38-DVD set of The Office for $50 this morning...and oddly now, I just connected my making that purchase with my current chair. It makes me remember something I do want to put into practice: set gym rewards at certain weights. Right now, I'm thinking that at < 200, to buy a Power Tower. I really want dips and pull ups to be part of my program—anything that promotes moving my body in space. As for now, there's just far too much resistance to do that sort of thing—though what do I know, I haven't tried—regardless, it makes a nice...well, not motivator, but I guess a cherry on top?

Overall, I am rocking life. I'm just waiting around for this fat to come off.

As it has been foretold, "Ba de ya, dancing in September."
