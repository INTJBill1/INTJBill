Today begins Day 2 of this Cardio Expedition. As I mentioned in my last post, my approach for this segment is all cardio. My emphasis is on an incline treadmill. To fuel motivation, it's going to be a movie march: cardio throughout the duration of a movie. It's befitting as we just picked up well over 200 movies from a video rental shop that's going out of business. Yesterday, I set up a computer monitor with a BR/DVD player to work in conjunction with the audio receiver that is already out in my gym so that it would be an inviting place to burn the miles.

Whereas I enjoyed listening to music with my past workouts, it got a bit repetitive and far too...reminiscent. There's a place for that, but I don't want to actively live there.

So for 35 posts leading up to June 25, I'll open up with a movie preview and title the blog with whatever movie I watched for the morning. It'll show a clean break from my First Expedition.
