My vitamins have been sorted into their pill organizer; my lunches are prepped for the week; four days of my morning and afternoon blends are set (space becomes an issue); I'm set for a power week.

I have just a little bit over 2 weeks before I weigh-in.  It's extra incentive to push hard.

I spent Friday night; Saturday and Sunday afternoons; and this morning at my new gym.  I'm really glad I didn't have to pay the $80 enrollment fee and $50/month with a contract.  There's some great resistance equipment there, but I wish it had other amenities like a pool and a basketball court.  Still, it has the cardio machines I need. But, I'm attracted to the allure to see what else is out there.  There's an Anytime Fitness location I'd like to try along with a non-franchise gym; it's really an issue of how long do I want to drive.  It's not that big of an issue with a 24-7 gym, but it gets dicey for gyms that like to sleep in past 5AM...and a gym has to be markedly better to justify the time (and gas) spent in travel.  Still, a gym that I'm considering would be better for my future running campaign.

I made some break through with my Sunday dinner treadmill.  I was able to push harder, though I suspect making a break from Vibram into the shock absorption of an athletic shoe played a significant role.

The Midnight's new album, *Kids*, just dropped.
