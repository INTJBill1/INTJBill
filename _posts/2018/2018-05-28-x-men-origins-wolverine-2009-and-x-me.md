It's the start of Week 3 of The Second Expedition.  Yesterday, I broke my 40-hour fast early...it wound up being only 24 hours.  I don't think I'll do that in the future and will leave my Sundays be.  It was a weird day for me as I also began planning to change my whole nutritional program.  It wasn't going to be a shift away from a low-carb regimen and I pushed to make it meet all the RDAs.  But, I was looking to make it into a "keto" diet around 70% calories from fat instead of my present 46%.  It proved impractical to do with a low calorie approach.  At the end of the day, it's all about calories in and calories out.  There's no magic meat that'll change that equation.  If I have to hit 1800+ calories to hit 71% fat, well, that's about 600 calories more than my diet today and a LOT of time on the elliptical to compensate for it.  If I pull the calories down on keto, than I can no longer meet my amino acid req's.  I won't even go into ratios.  No, the diet I've got is optimal for rockin' weight loss—it can't be beat.  Is it a thrill ride?  Hardly.  But, I've done my time having funzies with food.  This period of my life is one of transition—it feels like a time machine. Yes, I wanted to introduce chicken into my diet, but there will be a time for that.  When I open up the gates in and add more calories back in, it'll happen.  When I'm looking for muscle gains, I'll do it.

But, for now...it's all about the burn.

I'm looking forward to the summer.  On sunny days, I've been laying out, anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour, 15-minutes on each side.  I haven't [read his paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-16689-4) completely, but the reviews seem to justify my laying out for fat loss:

"'When the sun's blue light wavelengths—the light we can see with our eye—penetrate our skin and reach the fat cells just beneath, lipid droplets reduce in size and are released out of the cell. In other words, our cells don't store as much fat,' said Peter Light, senior author of the study, who is a professor of pharmacology and the director of the U of A's Alberta Diabetes Institute'" ([link](https://www.folio.ca/reduced-sunlight-may-contribute-to-winter-weight-gain/)).
