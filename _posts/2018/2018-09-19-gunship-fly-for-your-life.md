...and when I continue to think why THIS time is different, how this year since April has been consistent—outside of that one six-week period, my thoughts turn toward the specifics of my nutrition—oh, not the micronutrients, despite how much I love those—no, I believe a lot of my success comes from my soy coffee blends.  I just like them.  Twice a day.  Lunch was hard for awhile for me to figure out since I didn't know how to have a non-wincing approach to spinach, but this cold spinach and broccoli mix with the sauerkraut is something that I welcome.  Overall, I get the pop of great nutrition, a taste that I like, at a fat carving calorie rate.  I'm not doing anything that requires fortitude on my part.

When it comes to my activity, I've enjoyed my cardio while watching past UFC fights.  It's a place where I can detox from life for a bit and I actually miss it when I can't get it in.  I haven't felt the same about resistance of late, which may explain my failure to get that aspect of my workouts up to speed.

Overall with both diet & training, I don't have this firm clench where I'm using all my willpower to overcome the insurmountable.  No, I'm just in a flow as the fat just falls off.  There's nothing to do but wait.  Now, I will say that I have removed food as a fun activity to pass the time...or something to manhandle as I watch a movie.  In fact, my dinner workout is fantastic to skip food altogether in the evening!  Food anymore is just a "get in & get out" situation.  And I love my supplement regimen.

And it's really about the ease with all the prep done once a week for my lunches and maybe twice a week for my blends.  Again, it's the significance of the simple.  The less thinking I have to do, the more success I'll have—assuming of course that an effective amount of thought has already been undertaken for its setup.
