Of all days, I would injure myself on a non-resistance day. In about 35 minutes of my Do-San session, I simply threw a backfist in a front stance and felt something in my back akin to the tension when I first stretch in the morning; immediately after, all of my movements were in pain in the pattern. It's a simple move, no different from throwing a punch, and Do-San only has two backfists in it—clearly, the injury had nothing to do with fatigue. That said, Friday's bagwork included a forearm/backfist combo, so that must have weakened it.

Regardless, it's not my left foot but my right lats that is the first to go in my training. That said, I'm still dealing with left foot pain. I work through it getting off the treadmill during its crescendo and hop on the bike, where I can shift contact with the pedal to minimize risk.

I finished up my cardio for the day and have been healing up my lats with Tiger Balm, stretches, and massages. Tomorrow is a rest day, but I hope it heals up by Monday as any resistance day would be difficult, and Monday is actually the one for my back.

Today was my fantasy music day, though towards the end I listened to Demon Hunter as injuries tend to forge me in reflection. This is a new song for me and intersects the path I'm upon:

It parallels my soul's thirst for more—the call and the prayer. I've made promising inroads toward physical restoration. But, I've ignored my soul's enrichment and acumen. While most accept a mind, body, and spirit division, I see it as a body and soul union: there is the machine and the one who is driving it. When the soul is unbalanced, the body follows suit. This physical revitalization will be shortly-lived if the spirit is not fed and invigorated. I'll be increasing my focus in my soul's development in the upcoming days and weeks ahead. I must feed my soul for it to flourish into my physique...
