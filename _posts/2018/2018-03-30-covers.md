As a new owner of a PSVR, I was delighted that Leo released this video. Whether it was intentional, I like the B story foray into our existence as a computer simulation.

If you had known me in college, you might recall that I possessed a metalhead aspect—or I must have found AMAZING deals on KISS paraphernalia and Van Halen vinyl (I didn't). I'd hammer hard Metallica, AC/DC et al. In those days, I felt like some of the best love songs were found in '80s power ballads from bands like Def Leppard, Bon Jovi, a little Skid Row—clearly, Don't Know What You Got (Till It's Gone).

Metal was a journey through the surface of the cool waters of an INTJ personality deep into the fiery turbulence below. I liked the genre for the reasons of how Leo portrays it. There remains a virile aspect of me that retains that passion. And yes, Leo is a goofball, but unlike "college Bill," thirtysomething me developed into that as I took myself a lot less seriously.

In another convergence between music and gaming, I've been watching my kids play my new top-ten favorite video game character of all-time AND I haven't even played the game! The Starlord from Lego Marvel 2:

...and because of the game, I now have Redbone's Come and Get Your Love as an earworm: "come and get your love, come and get your love, come and get your love"—well, you get the idea; that's now stuck in my head.
