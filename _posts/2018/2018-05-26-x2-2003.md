I may have overtrained yesterday, for I was fighting against fatigue most of my workout this morning, preventing me from taking it to a higher gear until the last 20 or 30 minutes.  My body tempted my spirit to quit, but I didn't.  It was important to hit that 6AM mark.   Who knowsâ€”without his movies, perhaps the powers of Tom Cruise left me? After the morning workout and my protein shake, I began cutting the grass around 6:50AM, finished around 9:11AM, and I then loaded up the trash in my truck, and headed off to the satellite dump.

I still have another hour of cardio to squeeze into this day until I can close the book on the 2nd week of The Second Expedition.

Without weighing, I know I lost substantial weight yesterday:  after a botched moustache trim, I decided to shave off my entire beard.  An 8-month-old beard.  You could have found me on Duck Dynasty.  It was awesome.  Yet, it's nice to see me again.
