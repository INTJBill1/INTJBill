And the results of my 4th Expedition:

**43 lbs.**

...beating out The First Expedition by 2 Â½ pounds. Booya!

During this time, my daily blog posts with titles led up to this playlist creation:

The setup to The Expeditions were blog post titles involving song lyrics involving the night.

The First Expedition used titles in the style of The Big Bang Theory.

The Second Expedition used movie titles and the trailers from films I watched during my workouts.

The Third Expedition was sadly a wayward misadventure that spun out of control into the wastelands.

The 4th Expedition dove into cyberpunk, retrowave, and synthwave.

The 5th Expedition is...you'll see.

Now...we're on to November 20.
