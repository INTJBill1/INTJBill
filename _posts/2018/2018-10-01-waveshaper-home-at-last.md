Hello October!

I went on a 9-day streak of going to my town's gym before breaking it Sunday. I had planned to continue the streak , but instead, I did lawn work and began moving my tools, workbench et al over to my gym space as I've removed the old elliptical and recumbent bike.  It was hard for me to do anything in the other garage because of the onslaught of spiders, bugs, and mice.  But more importantly, the lighting is awful and it has a sloped floor.  It'll be good to create things out of wood again.

After creating my lunches for the week, I prepared my breakfast and dinner soy blends for the next 6 days.  I would have made that 7th, but I simply ran out of cooked soybeans.

Again, I want to underscore the importance of having go-to meals.  There's not even a consideration of breaking my diet when it's so easy to eat.  At $7.98 for 25, the reusable [Snap Pak Food Storage Containers from Sam's Club](https://www.samsclub.com/sams/snap-pak-storage-container-se/prod21020508.ip) are a great resource to use .

I'm a little bummed that I didn't go to the gym to work on Sunday.  However, it's 1pm-6pm operating hours on that day are ridiculous.  I really do need my early mornings to get the most bang out of my workouts. That said, it wasn't a rest day for me.  After the breakfast cardio, it was a functional fitness kind of day, followed by my dinner cardio.  But, I shouldn't hang my hat too much on my workouts, while up to now, I haven't given much thought to building up my cardio, the core of my weightloss comes from my diet, not these workouts.  I have to remind myself of it, as workouts are harder than simply making the right food choice.  Now, in the future when I am at the weight I want, things will get interesting.  But for now, it's only about weightloss.  And if I can pick up enhanced cardio along the way, that's just more awesome for when I implement a running regimen come March 2019.

...and I'm absolutely excited about my progress by then.  Even now, I feel lighter, possess more agility, and experience increased range.  There's about 8 days remaining before I weigh-in and I'm gonna like the results...for about an hour.  And after that hour of celebration, it's time to look forward and move into The 5th Expedition with a November 20th weigh-in.
