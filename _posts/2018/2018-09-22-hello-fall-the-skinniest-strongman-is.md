Summer 2018 is now a memory.  It was a season of sweaty workouts, suntanning, backsliding, and rejuvenation.

Ignoring the sweltering weather of a September in the South, fall is now upon me. I love the fall—not for the reason why people love this season; falling leaves don't exactly enamor me, sure the palette color shift is superior, but I've never been a green person.

Why do I like fall? Fall has always been that season of change.  Sure, spring has similar qualities, but it's more of rising from the dead, technically change I suppose, but I'd classify it more as something completely different; the crescendo aside, spring and summer are the same thing, but only quantified by the delta with respect to buckets of sweat.  Fall is great: it turns off the growth of grass thereby marks the end of the yard mowing season and lessens and eliminates the need for A/C thereby saving mucho dinero, compadre.

Fall is the romance of yesteryear.  Fun memories are wrapped up in this time; times of beginnings and opportunities; and the promise of acquiring more knowledge in a discipline.

And perhaps what I LOVE most about the fall is when the temperatures fall off a cliff.  Perhaps its those Scandinavian roots emerging, but I love a brisk day.  Now, if I'm in the mood for a warm day, the perfect temperature is 63F.  I'm the type that when I'd teach college, I'd walk to class in December in shorts with an iced tea in hand.

## A Change: Gym Membership(s)!

As the fall is upon me, a new change:  I'm a new member to my town's gym.  My health insurance has a deal that for $30/m, I can visit a network of 11,000+ gyms.  It's specifically called Fitness Your Way.  Now, it's a pretty sweet deal for me, because I was already planning on spending $50/m for my gym membership.  Those are the kinds of deals that are actually deals.  I'm never one to fall to Black Friday hype.  If I'm not planning on buying something but a "sale" compels me, then I'm not saving money.

It's not only just for one gym, but it allows for more memberships elsewhere as well.  Unfortunately as to where I live, the next gyms are 20 and 30 miles away, like, well EVERYTHING else—it's not unlike when I lived in Williams, Arizona, the only difference is that there's not an I-40 with a 75 mph speed limit connection here.  Still, when I am in the mood for something different, the option is there.

Now why would I grab a membership when I've got my home gym?  Well, I took a hit when I lost both my elliptical and recumbent bike.  While my treadmill remains a solid piece of equipment, my left foot is banged up and I'm feeling the my old Miami injury.  I still have a solid, open space with mats, my resistance equipment, and heavy bag.

Thus, I'm using the new gym to supplement my routine. Apart from lunges, I don't have much in my home gym for leg resistance, so there's a big difference there!  And as I further development, there's some bodyweight exercises that I'm looking forward to doing.

I look forward to what direction it will take me.  I suspect I'll naturally push harder and the 9 ½ mile drive will make me that more devoted to my craft.

So this is fall.  Change is in the air, even if I gotta reach out and drag the cooler temperatures here.
