...ok, truth be told, I began this morning's cardio by finishing up MI:III before moving on to MI:IV.  I tried to finish it with yesterday's cardio, including a 30-minute session before bed, but couldn't.

Week 2 of the Second Expedition begins.  I haven't solidified any upgrades for this week in my training. While I miss resistance, this cardio-only program pours the sweat off of me.  While I previously heralded the super slow motion approach to resistance—I still believe it is superior for strength, I fear it make weaken motivation. But, it's great while working through an injury.  My intercostal injury that occurred two weeks ago is largely a nonissue now.  There's just a little tenderness if I contort my body just right, but it no longer impacts my day-to-day.

Of course, I want full cardio in the mornings, and as to any time I carve out for something else, would it make sense to go resistance if cardio is superior for fat loss?  What good is muscle definition behind a slab of fat? That said, there will be a transition into greater resistance adoption, but for now, the time would be better used by concentration on shredding the fat.

But, I do long for a resistance program by moving my body through space and look forward to a sub-200 lb weight when I'll buy a power tower for pullups, dips, etc.
