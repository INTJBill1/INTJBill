Another Friday!  The end of resistance for the week and when I get to refill my vitamin organizer.  A little bit of a shift for this upcoming week as my diet changes for The Third Expedition—specifically, bringing choline back into the supplementation as I taking the eggs out in a return to veganism.  Additionally, I think I'll be stopping by VitaminShoppe for Green Tea extract, though like my iodine, it may come in liquid form.

Again this morning, I had tension as to whether I should continue my quiet time or begin working out at 4AM.  I came to the conclusion (again) to train, as mental energy waned.  I squeezed a lot into the time I did have—more from Beeke, readings out of Job, a couple of worship songs, but I feared that by extending it another hour, it wouldn't be as fruitful.

Cardio was ok, though it was rough getting it off the ground as I got sick from the tannins.  I knew I couldn't drink 2 cups of my Darjeeling on an empty stomach, but 1 cup has always been ok...until today. Weight training was fine—I increased the weight on the DB triceps extension.  I also tagged a little bit of abs on the end, as I'd like to get back to doing abs 3 times a week.

I've had a luxury for the past couple of nights:  diet drinks—a Diet Dr. Pepper then and a Diet Coke yesterday.  Clearly, diet sodas are not the bastion of health.  But, it shouldn't impact my weightloss objectives.  Now, I read blogs that claim bits about insulin, but without showing the research, it might as well be just another spurious claim on a blog.  There's so much of that out there, but I guess it's because publishing content online has such a low barrier to entry that you'd trip over it.

Now I've heard and I'm sure you have heard as well about the correlation between obesity and diet drinks.  But, it kind of makes sense, doesn't it?  That people might recognize that they don't want added calories, so they drink diet.  And without any extra calories to spare, they don't grab that 5 gallons of Pepsi.  Yet with drinking diet soft drinks in of itself without a radical lifestyle change, no progress will happen.  It is like the drink never happened; unless it specifically replaces a high calorie drink, why would we think it would make an impact?

It's now less than three days from my The Second Expedition‘s weigh-in.  I look forward to seeing how the events of these past six-weeks culminate onto the scale.  On Monday, whatever the weight is, I'll take a moment to celebrate since it's gonna rock, then I'll move on into my cardio, forging ahead into The Third Expedition.
