I'm somewhere between ...Never Go Back and the Edge of Tomorrow.  On the one hand, I'm not returning to my old lifestyle of food gorging. It's actually a little difficult to condition myself to that lifestyle.  It wasn't something that was done overnight, but the result of bygone calendars.  I no longer have the interest to do that.  Sure, once I get off this strict regimen and its subsequent transition, there will be the occasional beer and slice of pizza and I wouldn't mind taking up grilling outside, but its no longer a driver for me.  Everything would have to fit into the larger picture of physical fitness.

Now, on the other hand, indeed, I am on the edge of tomorrow.  While I envision aspects of future, I am not quite there...nevertheless, I'm excited at what lies ahead...
