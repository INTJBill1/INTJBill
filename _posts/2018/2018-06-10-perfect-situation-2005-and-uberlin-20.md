I love the above track by Weezer.  I remember when it came out back in 2005. It was the first album I purchased for my new 1999 Yukon, it's leather interior quite an upgrade from my bicycle.  Yes, for five months after donating my truck, I chose to ride a bicycle for my 4 mile ride to my IT gig at UofM.  I was in great shape and had more cash than I knew what to do with.  Of course, the years would pass and after adding a wife and 3 kids, I'd leave that ol' Yukon behind in the snow at the Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport as a donation on Halloween night '14.

The mood of the song remains applicable today, a transition-feel toward something better.

Week 5 of The Second Six Weeks begins tomorrow.

I'm reminded of one of my anthems from summer 2012, the song below, that along with Shinedown and the soundtrack to Into the Wild, accompanied me with my learning and teaching in the Czech Republic.  There is something out there in the horizon, for I'm never been one to "go gentle into that good night."
