I'm typing up this post from my new laptop, an HP Envy x360 2-in-1 I picked up on sale from Best Buy on Saturday. It's a much-needed expense toward my accounting online studies. Through Amazon, I also added another HP product, its 12 CP Financial Calculator, a tool that will benefit me in '18, '19, and beyond. And finally, I'm now both a digital and print subscriber to the Wall Street Journal!

My older textbook approach will have its books in this week, even more significant as I've elected to use my scores from my two accounting classes 20-ish years ago and instead, use these days that remain before the First Day of School to teach myself Fundamentals of Accounting I & II to review the discipline. My time to prep for Spring '19 classes may be limited because of this development, unless I reevaluate my schedule in these upcoming days.

That said, I've got the framework mostly in place. One of these days, I gotta check out my upcoming study place in town at a college library. Not that my intent is to visit there everyday, but only when I require a fast, stable connection to the Internet.

In the thrill of the hunt of education, I've set aside the intensity of my weightloss regimen. Oh, I'm still on my diet and everything. I still daily put in the cardio and my steps feel lighter. But now, my 4AM workouts are spent sparring with a textbook.

I don't want to neglect my workouts; I still put in cardio in the 5 AM. But, instead of having a singular focus on one overall objective for a year, I'll be working toward two. And in some manifestation, the two will both be with me even when year-end goals are met.
