I'm a believer that 4am is the best time to workout. Everyone else is on pause and there is nothing competing for my attention sans some old tunes and the iron. The evening has too many inviting distractions. The only drawback is the early bedtime; I love watching movies, but my sleep schedule just can't afford it. Tonight, I'm going to add a cheat night to my scheduleâ€”no, no I'm not going to binge carbs. It's strictly staying up later. It's organic as I'll be out cutting the grass close to the time I begin winding down for the day.

The second week of my training program has come to an end. At this time, I have no plans for any organized weekend workouts. Of course, I will be cutting the yard for a couple of hours tonight, though that may change in the future. A guy is supposed to come out and see how manageable it is for him to use my land for hay. Basically, he cuts it once a year to sell the hay to folks in Memphis and I get it cut for free.

My training schedule is strong, yet I'm working out its efficiency and content. I've been working through the idea that my general workout is 1) warmup; 2) around 45 minutes of resistance, 3) and an hour of cardio. However, this morning, I had 61 minutes of resistance and that included my pulling spider curls from the program to speed up things. I've been tightening things up; for example, instead of counting in my head, I use a stopwatch for my 45 second rests. I've also been recording the start times, hoping to be quicker at kicking things off. Right now, from my head on the pillow to my foot hitting the pedal is about 12-15 minutes. Part of that is picking up a signal for phone and connecting to its dubious wifi as that's my sole access to the Internet.

I gotta have my tunes.
