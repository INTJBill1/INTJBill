Ahh, in the immortal words of the idiot savant David Lee Roth:

> I get up, and nothin' gets me down!

The fog has been cleared: I have financial aid to pursue studies in accounting in 2019.
It has been trying:

My student advocate thought I still needed my high school transcript and ACT scores although I was already admitted to the University the day prior;

The academic advisor I was assigned has all the work ethic of an unwilling or unable approach;

And the financial aid analyst sent me a form letter denial without doing her homework first.

Fortunately, this isn't my first rodeo as I've been in and around the University of Memphis for the past 22 years, sans that Alaskan Call to Adventure—though I still had FB ties to professors and staff! I've done everything for the University except play organized sports—even in that, I took 4 PE classes and used its rec center regularly. There's been a full spectrum:

1. Undergraduate student
2. Scholarship worker
3. Tested the concrete poured for a parking garage on campus for a summer gig at a civil engineering firm
4. IT employee (2x)
5. Graduate student
6. Graduate assistant
7. Taught a couple sections of English

—I even waited for the cable guy to show up to install broadband access at President Raines' house.

And yes, I was at the Liberty Bowl when we beat Peyton Manning's #6 Tennessee Vols. I could very well bleed Tiger Blue.

During this application process, it allowed me to review my past academic history. I won't lie: it amuses me that my LOWEST score on the ACT was the same subject I taught and once pursued a PhD. Oh, English: we've had such a winding relationship over the years. And think: the AP committee in high school initially wouldn't let me into its AP English class until my Dad went to the mat for me.

All that aside, the English is a waste of time. I'll choose GAAP over MLA any day of the week. Take that to the bank.
For I am now in development for the future. As it has been sung by Guns N' Roses:

> Yesterday's got nothin' for me,    
> Old pictures that I'll always see.    
> I ain't got time to reminisce old novelties.   

2020: An evolved and enhanced me.
