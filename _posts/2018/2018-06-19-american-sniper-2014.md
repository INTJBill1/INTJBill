Yes, there remains a week before I see what lies before me on the scale. The kickoff of The Third Expedition is thereafter—BUT, I've already developed a diet for it.

It's 994 calories. Generally, something that low isn't recommended because a haphazard approach fails to be nutritious, but this thing hits 100+% RDA and packs the wallop of a diet that's double the calories—48 grams of fiber, 93 grams of protein, and slides under with 16.7 net carbs. Check it out on diet page.  I'm hoping it'll beat out The Second Expedition's diet plan by being more filling with similar or better nutrition, while giving up 436 calorie advantage.  That's the difference of a workout! Granted, while low carb, it can't be labeled "keto," but in the final analysis it's all about calories.  In this pursuit of weightloss, would I rather do this or have a 3500 calorie with a perfect 75% fat macro?  At any rate, focusing on the macro shouldn't be the goal.  It's about the micros.

Of course, that's only one pillar of my program that kicks off this Monday.

I'm looking to make my cardio more effective—more on that later.  Just like my diet, I'm going to close out this week by doing what I've been doing, watching movies while working out and later posting their trailers with my journals.  When The Third Expedition begins, I've got twenty or so UFC DVDs to watch—something that its not so crucial for me to follow the plot, but action nevertheless. I don't foresee making any additional changes to my resistance program, though I'll consider the option of a circuit regimen.
