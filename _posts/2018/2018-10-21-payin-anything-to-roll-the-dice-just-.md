I've found my new approach with The Wall to be encouraging, even for a Saturday. It makes me consider moving away from working out to reach a certain minute mark, and instead, train to lose a set amount of calories. That's what we're doing, isn't it? For weightloss, it's chiefly about the calorie burn—as it has been said,

> I feel my temperature rising, higher, higher; it's burning through to my soul!

Minutes logged doesn't directly impact the scale and the waistline. It's the calories burned! But, we don't say I'm going on a 250-calorie run or whatever, it's a 30-minute run.

This approach clearly has its difficulties. Unfortunately, we're not embedded with calorie counters like the clock currency of Justin Timberlake's In Time. Thus, calorie expenditure is a generalized approached with a little faith toward the engineers from NordicTrack and Sole. And while I wish there was a way to have those estimations to be spot on, as long as the machines are consistent, then they can be used as a metric.

This calorie vs time approach has its benefits. Honestly, I don't get amped up in making a minor goal to put in X amount of minutes of cardio a day. It's an indirect approach to go after what I really want. However, if I say my training goal today is to reach a sum of 1500 calories or whatever for the day, then I can see the direct results of what I'm trying accomplish. I actually find this more motivational than any step count. It's 1500 calories that I would have relied on my BMR to lose and 1500 calories less come weigh-in time. That mindset is extremely satisfying.
