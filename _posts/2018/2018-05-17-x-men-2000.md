This morning was another good round of cardio.  I slogged out of bed this morning, so I chose to warmup on the bike for 5 minutes before I hopped atop the incline treadmill.  Somewhere around the halfway mark as I felt a little ache in my foot, I came off the treadmill and cranked up the bike to match the same intensity for 10 minutes. After that, I finished the movie on the treadmill.  As the credits rolled, I still had 8 minutes or so before 6am, so churned hard on the bike to the end.

In reference to my last post, I'm still considering how I should fire things up for weeks 2-6.  I wouldn't be opposed to waking up a half-hour earlier to 3:30AM to start cardio earlier, though it would eat into my 8-hour allotment for sleep.  I'd also like to add opportunities for cardio during the day and into the evening.  Since my intermittent fasting shuts eating down by 2:30pm, workouts are a great meal replacement.

But for now, one of my larger challenges is further developing my legs conditioning, The biggest factor that shuts me downâ€”or at just redirects me, is "something's amiss" aches.  I'm hoping those will subside as my bodyweight continues to plummet.

I feel like I'm having some real success in approaching my workouts this way.  While I do enjoy having resistance training in my regimen, there is far too many rest stops with that sort of thing, and again, the research gives a nod to cardio for fat loss.  There will come a time for it, and I look forward to it.  I'm already visualizing my time on a power tower.  I hope to build a rockin' bodyweight program.

In the meantime, I gotta tear down this effigy that took years to build of a guy who drove through Nacho Nights.
