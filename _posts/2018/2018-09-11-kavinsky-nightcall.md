It was ANOTHER morning when my alarm went off at 3:50AM and I was like, "Nope!"

When I did wake up, I did straightaway climb aboard the elliptical and watched a Travis Browne fight followed by a Mark Hunt / Ben Rothwell tussle. At 30 minutes, I didn't put in as much cardio as I would have liked which is the chief issue of squeezing into instead of carving into a schedule.

I examined this morning as to why I've been doing this.  I was clockwork earlier this year, so it's not a general disposition against scheduling or mornings. Is it chiefly due to my ability to effectively squeeze cardio throughout my day?  If on some level, I don't perceive a need, do I need it?

Yeah, my resistance is getting relegated to the background, but even consciously, I recognize that at this weight, it's not a high need for me beyond it's ability to burn those calories. Yes, long term, it's a great daily investment—it's why I want to do it in the first place—but I have a singular focus of being a furnace.

While I do get my daily work in, I do want that resistance element [because of some compelling research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/myncbi/browse/collection/55111941/).

But again, maybe I just think all of my sweat equity during the day is enough?

I need something more. One element that is challenging to bring into my day is a moment to read and research subjects. I'm unable to adequately squeeze that into my day—not in any sufficient, uninterrupted amount anyway.  And since what I do is driven by research AND...
