Whew...today was supposed to be a chest workout, but my arms are difficult to lift this morning. I have this idea I'm trying out: dumbbell incline press and fly; press and fly; and decline press and fly. As I'm building for endurance, it was all 4×15 with 45 second rest. Of course, there was the 30-min treadmill, but I only had time for 22 minutes on the bike.

I had a great Back & Abs workout yesterday and I feel closer to solidifying this workout. That said, I'm considering on introducing some Tabata sets of bagwork at the close of my shoulder workout on Thursday. I'd like to use Tabata into another context for tomorrow, but as I'm sucking down with fury this cinnamon soymilk with sunflower seeds and flaxseeds, my body is beat—that makes the best kind of workout.

I remain loving my exercise ball. I had one years ago but never gave it much mind. Perhaps, it's the height? It amuses me: for $23 it's a great replacement for my $300 computer chair. But, it's all about context right? Back when I bought the chair, I really wasn't looking to sit on a ball. I had little need to rotate my hips in a chair, even if Ace-of-Base's Beautiful Life pops on...*sigh* I date myself, oh just Ride Wit Me, c'mon "Ms Jackson, I'm for real." I guess we all just "wanna be a baller, shot caller, twenty-inch blades on the Impala."

If I were to grab one song to articulate this phase of my life, it's the New Radicals "You Get What You Give." It's posted on the video section of my site.
