While it was a challenge in of itself: I manage to resist the sweet call of slumber at 4AM after succumbing to the initial 3:50AM call to action. I don't know why it's more challenging this time around, though it seems to be this combination:

* A 5 something-to-6PM cardio last night;
* A 2nd day of intermittent fasting—last meal @ 2:30PM;
* My muscles are still healing.

Today's treadmill and elliptical workout absolutely wrecked me. But even amidst it, I recognized that if I keep pushing, I'll be more enhanced to do greater later. And honestly, what am I doing working out if it's not pushing me? How effective can it be if I didn't feel this way? If it's not, I might as well be dunking Oreos and slamming crullers back on a direct flight to the North Pole to be this year's Santa.

I'm considering on pushing my resistance regimen into the next six-weeks. In practice, I've done just that as in this week, I've only had my chest workout and even in that, I hit muscle failure. And while I applaud the benefits of a resistance and cardio program, I'm want to kick things off by developing stamina over strength gains. And c'mon, I'm on a heavily restricted calorie diet: ain't no Hulk traps gonna come out of that!

If I'm honest myself, while I like to maintain a strong structure, muscle gains are for cosmetic purposes only. I can't think of anything where I need more strength. But, I guess we can't ever have TOO much strength.

No, as I stated in The Plan, I want to run. I'll always be a broad-shouldered guy—that's a genetic gift. I'll never be one of those rail thin guys who are a lunch or two away from starvation. What I need to do is develop my capacity to run and drop significant, unnecessary mass to further extend my range. Weightlifting isn't the best approach at this time, though I do like it in addition to whatever I'm doing, so if I carved out more of my time, sure. However, to do it in lieu of my cardio is not the most effective approach. The past few days, I've had cardio morning, noon, and night. I suspect I can only keep this output for so long, so I may add resistance then.
