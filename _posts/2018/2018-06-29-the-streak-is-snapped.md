After 86 consecutive days of eating what I had planned, last night, I broke my streak of a calorie-restricted diet. I know some folks' diets allow for a cheat day every week or whatever, and I guess mine gives the option of a single night after 12 weeks (84d). In the spirit of breaking the streak, this morning I broke my workout streak. It's not that I slept inâ€”I even completed my readings for today. I just didn't feel the same "zing" that I feel for my morning workout...it might be due to overtraining, something I've feared that might eventually occur, especially in context to a cardio-only workout, and yesterday I did two hours of intensity followed by lawn mowing.

Though, I might shift the blame toward not having an empty stomach.  For many weeks now, my intermittent fasting closed out the eating portion of my day at 2PM (if not at 11AM).  Added to eating at night, I'm just not used to having a full belly.

What did I eat?  Did I make a run to the border?  Did I go McCrazy?  Did I dunk my head into a bag of Dorito's?

Aha!  Never!  It was a very minimal carb delivery:

* Almonds
* Sunflower Seeds
* Soynuts
* Pulled pork
* Ribs with the sauce washed off
* Pork rinds

Outside of the meat, it really wasn't an intake that's unfamiliar to my diets.  And whatever net carbs I incurred, as my current diet sits at 16.7, it should still remain under the 30 threshold.  The biggest issue would be calorie intake, and as my current diet is just under 1000, I don't think last night's vacation festivities make a huge overall impact on my program, even if it robbed me of the maximization of daily weight loss.  I'd suspect between BMR and my workout yesterday, that I still had a calorie deficit.

As far as this morning, I still stood at the crossroads of what do with that time.  If anything, there's further evidence that I don't need 2 hours of cardio.
