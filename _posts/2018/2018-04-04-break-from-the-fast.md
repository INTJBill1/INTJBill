After a tenacious pursuit of fasting in 2018, I'm shelving it as I gear up for another direction. While I love everything about fasting, my failings in it never achieved the results I wanted in this quarter of the year. Sure, I could keep pushing on and there's a part of me that wants to do just that, but ultimately, I don't want to reach the halfway point with just a rollercoaster ride to show.

Sometimes to go fast, we must go slow; sometimes a right turn leads to a left turn.

Thus, I enter Day 3 of a nutritional / training program I created. I go into its details elsewhere on this site, so I won't belabor it here. So far, I've added a good deal about its nutritional background and makeup though I have yet to codify its training approach. I love hybrid approaches and have a general idea in mind, but the challenging aspect is meshing up its rpm to me. I have a tendency to go with a zealous approach, as if I was 18 again in my parents' garage. And sure, there's a place for that in due time, but not in the beginning of a program. As an 80s movie once said, "your ego is writing checks your body can't cash." Big picture: what good is a hard-hitting training program that leaves me unmotivated to start its second week? I want results fast—who doesn't—but again, sometimes to go fast, we must go slow. I'm building something that can last beyond 3 months, not something that sputters out after a week.

As part of that program, I haven't changed my desire to bring in ChiRunning and foster a lifestyle that regularly engages in races, not for the external competition, but internal pursuits and the general community that can be found in those environments.

I'm planning on a return to Facebook in about 22 weeks from now. Perhaps long gone are the late nights at a greasy spoon or hours spent in a coffeehouse, but we need community nevertheless. And like Bonnie Raitt sang albeit in a different contact, "Let's give them something to talk about."
