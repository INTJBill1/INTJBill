This morning's workout was again based on the Jumanji routine. More specifically, today was all about the chest. My interpretation:

* Fire up the 90s era music: 1997 this time
* 5-min bike warmup
* Standing Cable-ish Flys: 7 sets with 15 reps
* Incline Flys: 4×15
* Hammer Press Incline: 3×10
* Flat Dumbbell Press: 3×12
* Superset: Flat Dumbbell Flys & Pushups to failure 4×12
* 30-min treadmill
* 15-min bike to slide into 6am

I don't have a standing cable fly machine—who would in a home gym, well, who would without some serious investment in their overall gym space...well, unless they just had a crush on that one particular exercise. I kinda pulled it off using one arm at a time with my Bowfex, though its fraught with its own tension with a range of moment. But, it warmed things up for me, even if the seven sets for each side took FOREVER. And it was better than nothing as my alternatives actually are already in the routine.

Everything went as planned until I was lit up by the superset of db flys and pushups. I finished my first set, got down to push up, and...nothing happened. Tried again. I watched my arms violently shake. I thought to myself, "Is this really happening? Am I faking it?" No, I met the criteria of the exercise: pushups to failure with 0 reps. I knocked out the rest of the fly sets and knew I would feel the pain tomorrow.
