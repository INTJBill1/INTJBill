Today's cardio was the middle-of-the-road for me.  Unlike yesterday's dunk into sweat workout, today was more of a mild drench.  As my legs are still recovering from the nonstop incline treadmill from yesterday, today, I would do 30 minutes treadmill, jump on the bike for 10, repeat.  I need to make a movie queue; I'm running into the same problem I had in the First Expedition with a delayed start due to setup.

As far as the film goes, Mission: Impossible came out as I was graduating high school.  It was fun to see the old tech.  I loved Prague, of course, and the movie included my favorite city in the world, London...well, I love Memphis for the richness of memories—but I watched Mission: Impossible, not The Firm.

I've been seeing this first week of the Second Expedition like the first week of the First Expedition.  You see, during my very first week, I chose not to introduce any workouts and wait for the 2nd week.  In that way, I could foster motivation during my nutrition change.  I feared that if I did too much in the beginning, the whole process might implode.

I've been considering that with this second six weeks.  Oh, not foregoing working out—that's nonsense, I'm already in rhythm.  Rather, it's the spirit of it. I would like to add more cardio into my day, though I don't even know what it'll look like.

Still, even in this first week, my workouts have been more intense overall than the ones from the First Expedition—at least afterward I'm more exhausted.

June 25th, I'm coming.
