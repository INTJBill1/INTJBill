I renew my fast again. This fast has been difficult, for we are creatures that obsess over the pursuit of, or the participation in, pleasure maximization. Intrinsic to finite pleasures is the reinforcement of a vortex that demands increasingly more satiation to meet its voluminous hunger. The luster of glossy pages is mere fantasy; nevertheless, cloaked by the night to hide from the morning light, we choose to enter the dilapidated house. Verily, it is the promise of a Snickers satisfaction that is the letdown of a carb overload overlord; the zing of a Twinkie is a chemical fluff aftermath.

Infinite desire will never be satisfied by finite attractions.

It is but an escape from the soulache.
