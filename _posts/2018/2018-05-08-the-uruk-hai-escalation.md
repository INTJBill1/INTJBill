I'm back into resistance. I don't have its application mapped out yet, but I will! I didn't step into Azeroth and get healed by a priest, either. Yet, I found a way to work around my right intercostal muscle injury. Last night, I researched [super slow resistance training](http://www.unm.edu/~lkravitz/Article%20folder/superslow.html).

I'm convinced it would be great for what I want to accomplish. I gave it a test run this morning, and made it halfway through my chest routine, as by definition, super slow resistance takes much longer. Using a modified Tabata timer on my iPad, I performed 10 seconds concentric + 10 seconds eccentric per rep, for a total of just 5 reps. I did my standard 4 sets. It was at a glacial speed, but I loved the control and the form involved. There are some great benefits for what I want to accomplish:

1. First and foremost, I don't have to wait 4-6 weeks for resistance training. As R.I.C.E. has been disavowed by its creator and falls out of practice; I prefer working the injured area within the context of M.E.A.T. since I don't feel shards of pain when I move slow;
2. There is minimal risk of new injury or re-injury;
3. Minimizes weight creep: I want my iron set well-worn before I have to chase more cash after it.

I abhor a runaway train of machismo. How I grow weary of "bruh" advice and antecedal evidence. I have an impression that there are those who take identity by the weight they can lift, though they really ought to give credit to inertia and gravity...which routine would I prefer if I was clinging on the side of a rock face?...at any rate, it's NEVER about the objects...did the workout put me in a better position toward the objective? If wearing a pink tutu outside of a McDonald's window while dancing on roller skates to the tune of The Supreme's You Can't Hurry Love is your ab routine and works...well, as the Steve Miller Band sang:

"If you keep on dancing, you'll never grow old...dance, dance, dance."

I'm also trying out a shift toward intermittent fasting. While I wish it was possible for a [one-meal daily approach](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/85/4/981/4648934), for my food is far too bulky (a lb of romaine is a LOT), I'm adopting a 16:8 approach, where I have an 8-hour window to eat. Additionally, I'm going to adopt a fasting on Sundays approach, for both its physical and spiritual significance.
