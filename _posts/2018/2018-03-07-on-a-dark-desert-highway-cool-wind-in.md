After an extended time locked away from public review in "maintenance mode," I unfurl this site again. As an introvert, this transition is never comfortable; everything is aglow beneath the stage lighting and if I may quote out of context:

> The honesty's too much   
> And I have to close my eyes    
> And hide    

Yet, I fling myself out in the dark abyss, in the great hope of...well, nothing. I'm under no delusion that my audience is likely a cold, small order of McDonald's fries with Russian, Chinese, and generally Eastern European hackers—AND they're BOTS at that! So, welcome, my mischievous, mustachioed machines! Live long and vote for me, your kind overlord, in the upcoming Cylon elections. I will bring peace, freedom, justice and security to my new empire while trainwrecking several science fiction franchises along the way. "Hey Bill: J.J Abrams is on line 1 and wants his likeness back."

It's funny: for the lack of an activity—literally not eating...though I suppose nothing is stopping me from doing a walkthrough each night—oh yeah, my sanity...why do I feel the surge like I'm doing all that I can to hang on to this...well, my initial impression was a bull, but this fast is gonna be a lot longer than an 8-second ride. Jet ski? Never been on one. And frankly, saying I'm holding onto a raft and getting shot out of cannon likely fails to hit its semantic mark...

...ooh, got it: remember that scene from Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation when Tom Cruise runs up to a taxiing plane and latches on during takeoff? ...it's exactly like that. Ok, not exactly. That looks like a rack-of-ribs kind of fun. Maybe once I drop this weight, I'll take up rock climbing. Clearly, it'll be after the weight loss, because for right now, it leans a little heavy toward low-altitude skydiving and not an 8-second ride at that.

Thus, I'm into this fast with a pair of crazed-focus Tom Cruise eyes—no-no not the ones in that baggy from Minority Report. Fine, fine. No more Tom Cruise. Even if my days repeat like Edge of Tomorrow. Ok, ok, no more.

In the meantime, I'll just be...on the "highway to the danger zone!"
