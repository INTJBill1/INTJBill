Now that I'm beyond the Underworld series, I begin the second movie from the Resident Evil franchise.  Yes, there's that little bugger inside of me that gnaws because I don't start with the first one, but I never could find it at the now closed video rental shop.  But, it's ok because I've seen it enough I could do a decent retelling of the story.  It's not as much of fun to do cardio to movies I know well, and hence why I've been staying away from my stalwarts—who knows, I haven't ruled out Oceans 11-13, Passengers, Into the Wild, or even Stranger Things.  But, I don't see myself delving into my ST:TNG or DS9 sets.

Speaking of Stranger Things, instead of an introduction, I discovered synthwave music month prior before watching the show for the first time.  I really enjoy the genre and (not a) SURPRISE, I pulled out my text editor returned this website back to the scheme I created with a retrowave vibe.

I returned the recumbent bike to my gym.  There still remains a place for it in my regimen.  Today was a good workout, though my intensity began to die out in the last half hour.  I suppose my muscles being taxed is bound to happen on a low carb, intermittent fasting diet as the last time I ate was around 11AM the day prior, and I had another workout between this morning and then—so, not a whole lot of glucose to tap.  I need to rotate exercises to keep my heart rate up.

However, I smashed through yesterday's wall.  I'm thinking it was due to my sunbathing, at least that's my experiment for now.  Or, more specifically, I'm sweating out electrolytes faster than I can replace, or more specifically, sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride and/or magnesium.  I don't know if I can work out in the morning and lunchtime along with sunbathe.  But, it's just a working theory at this time.

To maximize intensity, I'm considering on bringing my resistance program back into the morning so that I can push hard on cardio and do resistance, while later in the day, return to higher intensity cardio.
