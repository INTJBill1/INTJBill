As far as my workouts go, it was a weird morning; I didn't have my workout codified beyond generalizations. Previous, I had 9 or so Tabata sets with Taekwondo and 4 Abs exercise.

Nevertheless, I press-performed through Chon-Ji and Dan-Gun a couple of times, through and did 6 reps of Do-San. I followed that up with 30-min on a 3% incline on the treadmill, 30 min bike intervals, and finished off to 6AM with a 11-min return to the treadmill incline.

I felt invigorated after my workout—well, after the initial fatigue passed. Since the cardio or kata really isn't something new, well, I did do the bike and the latter treadmill in the dark, I'd have to guess that my switch over to intermittent fasting is the difference maker...or maybe my body broke through some weight plateau that I haven't been tracking.

I am excited about Monday's weigh-in. I could take an educated guess at where I am +/- 5lbs. Whatever it is, I'll celebrate in the moment, record it on my chalkboard in my gym and later post it on this site. Then I'll quickly move on toward the next after 6 weeks weigh-in on June 25. Sure, wins are great but they belong on the mantle, not the hand; I'm nowhere near where I need to be, the vision I see. Even the Facebook emergence come September is a milestone to hit, but it's not the goal. Now, my hope by then is that hitting weight targets will be a thing of the past, and by then, it will be achieving performance...like, I would absolutely love one day to have a home gym with some elements from American ninja—so, a bodyweight focus. And clearly, martial arts is a focus. Freely moving through three-dimensional space holds far more desire within me than picking up metal blobs just to set them down again.

But all of that is in the future. And while dreaming can inspire action, I've got tomorrow's shoulder workout coming, one that has modified for super-slow motion. It'll be a first for me.
