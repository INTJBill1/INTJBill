In preparation for today, I ran across [my doppelgänger-brother](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_LEX4n9lOs) whose parents are John Krasinski from The Office and David Harbour from Stranger Things:.

Thus, it is a Shoulders day for me. And I can't lie: for taking up a small amount of real estate next to my head, my entire body is worn out. I adopted a large segment of the Jumanji workout and denoted with an * the alternative exercises I chose:

* Pop in alternative music from 1995
* 5-min bike warmup
* Dumbbell Lying Rear Delt Raise*: 5×15
* Seated Bent-Over Rear Delt Raise*: 4×12
* Dumbbell Side Lateral Raises: 3 sets of run the rack up and back down again with each set 25-20-15-12-20 reps. For those of you who are counting at home, that's NINETY-TWO reps a set. And yes, I went over and picked up my air dumbbell that was next to my air guitar for the first 25 and final 20.
* Dumbbell Front Raises: 4 sets x 10+10 reps \| palms up + palms facing
* Standing Dumbbell Shoulder Presses: 4×20
* 30-min on the treadmill
* 25-min on the bike to push past 6am

One of the larger challenges of this workout was maintaining good form.

Though it did tear me down, I'm feeling pretty swoll right now. That post workout high of accomplishment is hard to beat. It amuses me that it wasn't too long ago I was staying up to 3:53 AM to catch a Tokyo sunset—now, I'm waking up at that time.

I feel like I'm drawing closer to the creation of a workout schema (that will be tweaked endlessly). When I do, I'll be adding it as a new tab to this site.
