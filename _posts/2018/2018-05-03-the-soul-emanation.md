Another workout is in the books and with the Nordic drums propeling me on, I come away from it completely spent. Briefly while failingly to perform Dan Gun to my satisfaction, for I screwed up by doing my shoulders regimen before my forms, I thought the whole TB12 method of no weights was the way to go. It's funny how robotic and non-agile I was while doing my Taekwondo pattern after the shoulders exercises.

My dad always advised against lifting and he was a 2nd degree in California in the '60s, when they weren't a dime-a-dozen, which included training overseas; he also was a boxing champion as a two-tour Vietnam Marine Corps Recon Sniper after serving in the Army in Koreaâ€”he enlisted at 16; a pro fighter; an LAPD officer during those chaotic times; and even in his late 40s as a Shelby County Sheriff's Deputy, would bust into houses in the middle of the night on fugitive warrants. He developed a wealth of applicable strength.

Now, that wasn't his whole story of course, for he was a thinker as well as a fighter. Born during the Great Depression and picking cotton by hand at the age of 4, he was an ESFP with a 158 IQ with a 7th grade education until he went to USC to earn a degree in Graphics Design with a minor in Political Science which led to the eventual starting of his own printing business. He once walked off a job because his boss told him he would fire him if he didn't stop whistling while he was running two printing presses at the same time! I was born when he was 40 and he remains my hero even though it's now been 14 years since we last talked. He introduced me to my favorite music group, Simon & Garfunkel and we shared a love for Elvis. Awesome guy. As the Shinedown lyric goes:

> All my heroes are dead and gone   
> But they're inside of me   
> They still live on   

So if a guy like that doesn't put a lot of emphasis into lifting heavy, neither do I. I know everyone in the bodybuilding community seemingly loves squats, but they're the dumbest thing to me. In what scenario does that actually happen to me? I mean, maybe if I lived in a 3rd world country and had to bring back water to the village via water buckets and a pole...no, it's a silly thought and I don't do silly exercises. If I was just in it for the looks, I'd just save a lot of sweat equity and use makeup shading. For my money, a lunge is the superior and far more applicable to life.

But for now, it's all academic as I need to drop additional weight as I don't feel safe with my knees, a once bane of mine, but have been silent for years. I'm likely to bring lunges back into my life in July.
