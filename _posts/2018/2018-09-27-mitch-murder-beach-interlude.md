I'm upping my supplement game. I'm removing the following from my rotation...

...leaving these in the starting lineup...

1. Vitamin D3, 5000 IU
2. B12, 5000 mcg
3. Calcium with Vitamin D3, 800 IU & 600 mg
4. Choline & Inositol, 250 mg
5. Triple Strength Green Tea Extract, 750 mg

...and the NEW from Vitamin Shoppe as I take these horses out of the stable:

1. Kelp
2. Cayenne Extract, 450 mg, 80,000 hu
3. Ultimate 10 Probiotic, 13 billion
4. [Vitamin Shoppe Ultimate Man Multivitamin](https://www.vitaminshoppe.com/p/ultimate-man-multivitamin-180-tablets/vs-2750)
5. Ginkgo Biloba Extract, 120 mg

I'm really stoked about the additions.  While I'm stilled keyed up about fat loss, I'm looking toward the future with better health and performance.

In a prior post, I referenced how much I've lost this year and the lbs I'm going to lose by New Year's Day 2019.  But, I need to return my focus back to where I find myself, The 4th Expedition.  Sure, the past is great and the future in the distance is fun to dream about, but it is imperative that I stay locked into the present.

I entered this expedition at 288. If I can get down below 247 ½, I will have beaten The First Expedition's lb success.  Now, clearly, it's easy to get big numbers with initial weight loss and a larger start—the math just works that way.  I feel really good about this 4th Expedition and it should outclass The First Expedition—just my involvement at the new gym alone can drive that sort of success.
