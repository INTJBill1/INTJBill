Befittingly on the last movie in my move through the Mission: Impossible series—until July 27 anyway, I added a machine to my gym that should minimize the foot problems that I've been working to avoid injuring further.  For $40 at Goodwill, my wife found an elliptical that retailed at $1500+.  Boom! It's solid as a rock; I've already spent 100 minutes on it. It's a fantastic addition to my cardio stable with the treadmill and the recumbent bike.  Losing this excess fat and becoming lean is feeling more and more like becoming a reality.  There's a very good possibility that I'm going to blow the doors off the 40 ½ lbs that I lost in the First Expedition.

She also surprised me by picking up the spray bottles and microfiber towels I needed to clean off the equipment after I'm done, along with some new workout clothes since I'm obviously smaller.  I also wanted a lawn chair I can layout above the deck as I sunbathe and *BAM* she got that.

My additional approach for this Week 2 of the Second Expedition is to finalize adding 30-min midday cardio and 30-min endday cardio.   I remain tempted to bring back my resistance regimen, yet if I have the time for a 45-60 minute session, why wouldn't I just do cardio instead to maximize the fat loss since that's the chief goal?  However, now that I think my intercostal injury is over, I might sneak in some ab work during the day.
