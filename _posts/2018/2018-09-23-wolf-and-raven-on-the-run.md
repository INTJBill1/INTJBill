I am loving my new opportunities at the gym I joined on Friday night.  It solidifies that this weightloss journey is not just a temporary chase, but has reached  a place of legitimacy for me to bring it public. If I wasn't serious about it, I wouldn't have joined a gym—I don't chase good money after bad, even if I got a smokin' good deal even finding a coupon to waive the $30 enrollment fee. Just straight up $30/month.

However, I did set up another monthly purchase for my gym time.  For $10/month, I subscribed to UFC Fight Pass—it's the Netflix of MMA. It allows me to watch most of the fights of a particular fighter across the promotions: UFC, Strikeforce, K-1, etc.  I brought my iPad into the gym and caught a few McGregor fights (Alvarez, Diaz II, Brimage, Duffy).  The other night, I watched UFC 1, something I haven't seen since I rented the video cassette from Hollywood Video sometime back when I was in college.  The UFC has evolved so much since then...the first UFC is laughable now: bare-knuckle fighting with the only rules being no eye gouging, groin strikes, or biting...and back then, no real application of a ground game until Gracie single-handedly morphed the sport. Today's game is brilliant to watch as I applaud its chess match of strategy and application.  And unlike basketball, football, etc., the game is never in a place where an opponent can't win, even when a fighter is behind on points, they are just a knockout or a submission away from winning.

...and for my purposes, it's good for my cardio...though I wouldn't be opposed to re-upping my Netflix subscription when I'm ready to move on...though I don't care how much I love The IT Crowd, it's never gonna jazz me up to train hard.

Speaking of training hard, I'm still dealing with a whacked up left foot.  It affects my Fitbit count but the time I've been spending on the elliptical (45 minutes yesterday, 80 today) hopefully makes for the loss time.  The thing about weightloss, even 70+ lbs, is that I don't feel a whole lot different.  Sure, I'm lighter on my feet and move my body more effectively; I get to notch holes into my belt—there's all sorts of that kind of stuff, but I haven't reached a place where I feel I have changed.  And it makes sense—I'm just not there yet.  I can't even think about victory until sometime in March next year.  And even in that context, I'm not done; it'll be all about what can I do with my body and how to never again pack on unhealthy weight.  But, all of that is for another time.

Today, I eat my foods and train toward an objective, maximizing motivation and minimizing risk.
