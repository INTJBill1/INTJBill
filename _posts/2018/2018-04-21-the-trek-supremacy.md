While I intended to make Friday a cheat night, I still more or less went to bed the same time and woke up this morning at 4am. I did get to my gym 5 minutes later than normal. While it remains a rest day with regards to resistance, I did put in a total of 135 minutes of cardio. Unfortunately, I aggravated an old foot injury I picked up in the airport in Miami back in 2012. I intended to spend the day curling a weedwacker, but I chose to postpone that rendezvous.

I still don't have this week's new workout planned, though I have an idea to shore up the time issues I've been having from Friday's workout: instead of performing exercises one arm at a time, just combine them. Also, after further research thanks to YouTube's Scott Herman, from here on out, I will work my curls in a supinated position instead of the prone. For as long as I can remember, I've just pulled up curls while twisting up, not knowing I wasn't fully engaging the bicep. I'm also going to try [what he suggests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxrZlIl35U) on an incline bench which basically amounts to a drag curl.

I'm excited as I just purchased off of Amazon the DVD box set of my trek series, Deep Space 9. Don't get me wrong, I love me some Picard, but DS9 has more complexity and provides more mystery to space...and I'm a Ron Moore fan. For me, DS9 is a precursor to BSG. I will also be receiving the complete Harry Potter collection on Blu-Ray.

I'm going to really try and make Sunday a rest dayâ€”well, I do need to sweep and mop the gym...
