**40 Â½ lbs**

These are the results after my First Expedition of six weeks.  I got there with a shredding nutrition program and about 50-60 minutes of resistance 4 days a week (plus a 5th day having 20+ min), with 40-60 minutes of cardio 6 days a week. It's a win.

Now it's time to move on from the celebration.  I'm rolling it back to like it was day 1.  It's a new season, essentially.

I'm going to beat that number.  Yes, it's going to be a challenge.  I don't have the advantage of being bigger or the initial water weight losses, especially as my advantage of being on a low sodium is gone.  But, I'll be employing intermittent fasting along with my 40-hour Sunday fast full time.  And my newest adaptation for the Second Expedition is a complete focus on cardio.  There's such a shift in that direction that my 4-6AM workouts will only be cardio.  Any plans I have for resistance will have to be at a different time in the day.  Don't get me wrong, I love lean muscle mass, but at this time, its development is a secondary focus.  For now, I only care about fat shredding.  I'm not making any substantial changes to my diet. I'll be adding an oz of pickles into my romaine / spinach / broccoli medley as I give myself 200 mg of sodium to play around with, so that it'll replace my Louisiana Hot Sauce.
