My silence on my workouts doesn't mean they met a premature end; no, I am in my laboratory, mixing various compounds and isolates. This morning was an Abs & Cardio and lemme tell ya, I am BEAT—even 90 minutes after its end! I planned it to be a lighter day with my 5-min coffee alt, 25 minutes of ab work followed by 70 minutes of cardio. Even my mind feels a little woozy.

I thought my gym was adequate for everything I wanted to do. Yet, there is a piece of equipment that I really need. I considered rewarding myself with it once I hit a future weight, yet it is a tool to actually get to that weight. Last night, I bought an [incline bench](https://www.amazon.com/Fitness-Reality-Super-Adjustable-Weight/dp/B01CR4XFIK/) off of Amazon. I've been using the incline setting on my Bowfex—it's wobbly and technically doesn't lock in place. It's fine for its intended use, but fails as a replacement. With a delivery that will be just in time for Arms Friday, my incline bench will allow me to add spider curls which were impossible otherwise. I've run across several routines that I would have liked to have added, but couldn't. For example: I'm curious to try out situps on the decline setting.

The next purchase wasn't a necessity, but serves to augment my core. It also slides into what I feel is the best approach to training, that is one that is organic to your life (I'll write more on this at a later date). I bought [an exercise ball](https://www.amazon.com/Trideer-Exercise-Anti-Burst-Stability-Supports/dp/B01GE7F3R2) that will be a tool for my gym space and hopefully will be effective replacement for my office chair at the computer.
