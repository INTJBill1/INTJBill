There's nothing like having a stall in your workout when your TREADMILL needs to download an update. I mean, C'MON, the function is pretty straightforward—get-out-of-the-way and let the hamster do his work!

It's been a long haul since that first week through the Rock's Jumanji workout, now that I'm in the fifth week of training. This is what I ran through this morning:

## WARMUP & TKD

* 5-min Bike Warmup
* 5-min Stretch
* 1 Chon-Ji – 3/4 speed
* 1 Dan-Gun – 3/4 speed
* 3 Do-San – 3/4 speed

## RESISTANCE

* for **Deltoid, Posterior:**    
Dumbbell Seated Rear Lateral Raise    
5 reps at 20 sec each, 4 sets    

* for **Deltoid, Lateral:**    
Dumbbell Lateral Raise    
5 reps at 20 sec each, 4 sets

* for **Deltoid, Anterior**    
Dumbbell Arnold Press    
5 reps at 20 sec each, 4 sets

## CARDIO
* 30-min Bike Intervals
* 30-min Treadmill Incline (grr, it irritated me that these two had to swap)

An aspect of having your own home gym is that you can flip the lights off and work in the dark in the cardio phase. I love listening to music in the darkness whether generating the amperage or shutting it down in the shower later.

While this shoulder workout is a smaller regimen than my standard, super-slow resistance sets my muscles on fire! I can actually feel each specific delt after the specific exercise that works it.

I'm consider on concentrating my resistance this way so that I can spend more time on cardio, TKD, and research. Additionally, I've been playing around with sneaking in a cardio session toward the end of my day. I've been feeling like my intercostal injury will let me return to my abs regiment if I focus specifically on the abs themselves and fight momentum...obliques may be pushing it.
