In my attempt to finish up a Netflix series, I stayed up past my 7:30PM bedtime—WELL past it. I knew the consequences, but I figured with one last day of the service remaining, I would just push off the morning workout for later in the day.

And I did. Sorta.

It was a mistake. The garage was a bit hotter than my pre-dawn workouts back in early July. I thought I could pick up right where I left my last chest workout. I even made a mistake by adding 5 lbs MORE than my last dumbbell flys, which that alone might have tanked my performance.

I didn't get through my regimen. It's a really simple one, 4×12 each of dumbbell press and flys, in the following scenarios: incline, flat, and decline, with a 30 second rest on the elliptical between sets. But, as I was fighting through the fatigue with the decline sets, I found myself performing flys instead of a 2nd set of presses, and couldn't press...and just exhausted. I hit the showers and could barely lift my arms up as I regretted not taking that 4AM.

But, despite the lack of capacity, it's good to return to working out. I needed something to exert against the inertia of that big ol' granite ball. Today has been a win, even if by a slim margin.
