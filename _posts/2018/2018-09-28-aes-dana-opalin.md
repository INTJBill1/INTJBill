I offloaded the responsibilities of connecting to my Verizon Jetpack and sharing it with a wifi router from my 2009 Dell to a headless Raspberry Pi.  Not only am I saving all sort of space, I'm also saving electricity as I run it 24-7.  I've got three Raspberry Pi 3's and while I think they are the neatest thing, I never do anything with them.  So, it's good to put one to task.

As for now, my Dell workhorse is in a semi-retired state in the closet.  Is it time for me to move on from a desktop?  I can't do any (serious) image editing with my other tools.  But, do I need to do that anymore? There are some serious web design limitations, but I'm content with what I created for this site. I really like Gnucash, and trying to use Google Sheets as a replacement has some obvious limitations.  Yet, is a desktop-less world a transition that I'm ready for?  It's been such a HUGE part of my life leading up to now.

I referenced consistency in a prior blog as an approach for weightloss success.  What I neglected to detail, is that it is a consistency consistent with Bill Murray's Groundhog Day.  I basically just live the same day over and over and over again...until one day when I either snap my diet streak or I transition to a maintenance approach.  I don't ever stop improving on what I'm doing, consider approaches and so forth, but is that really any different from Bill Murray's character?

When I train in solitude in my own gym, I feel...like I am playing in rhythm to what I watch.  And when I go to my town's gym, the inspiration of watching something like UFC bouts via my iPad is still there.  It's good that it is, because if I were to draw from the energy of those at my gym in those early mornings—well, it's just a step above hanging out at McDonald's knocking back the coffee with the old men.  Too much standing and jibber-jabber going on as I look below from my second floor cardio perch.  When guys do finally muster enough vigor to take a break from the conversation and lift, they do so in their workboots and blue shirts with embroidered names.  I get a sense that they don't respect their training.

Friday night, I spent 85 minutes on the treadmill at home.  Sure, I had 45 slotted for the evening, but I was just feeling good and watching the main card to UFC 172 from April 2014.

Come to think of it, a LOT has happened since then in my own life, considering it doesn't seem that long ago—just down the street in the ol' DeLorean.  It's almost like I can reach out and grab it.
