I'm considering on moving beyond this synthwave theme for my website, one in which I've built and tinkered around thereafter since 2017.  I've updated it as a child theme for WordPress themes *Make* and *GeneratePress*; a standalone HTML file; and for this latest iteration using *Minimal-Mistakes*.  While I like it (CLEARLY), I wonder if it's time to move on?

I want to change my focus...change the core of things.

Honestly, I would like to spend more on content than color...while still giving heed to legibility, of course.  If I never see another needling serif font for body text, my life would *not* be incomplete!  And honestly, if a website goes way past 544 px for its text's width, I'm thinking either it's a) the '90s again; or b) I'm on a safari across my monitor waving to Mordor as I pass!

I began listening to an album from my past that was a regular on the rotation at a coffehouse back then, the music I heard after a turbulent and transformative period of my life, some 20 years ago in this upcoming fall season.  Twenty years ago this August, I failed a Business Finance class—the first F of my life and I didn't care—I didn't even show up for the final.  The funny thing is that I liked the professor and still remember his market advice.  But, I was at the threshold of thunder as it was the opening salvo of the storm for my soul.    

And at this point I'll leave my audience to pick up tomorrow...
