The 16th Expedition: 20âš¡25 is in its final hours of the countdown to tomorrow's weigh-in.

As such, I have reached the last song of the Expedition, which in practice, was the first song of this Expedition's workout and is singular apart from the rest.  It's sort of a [The Beginning Is the End Is the Beginning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OEvDqRr898) by The Smashing Pumpkins type of situation.

In developing [the OST for The 16th Expedition](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/36hQjVrc1Bim0sCAKV2fQt?si=2s0LzzRiSDaFZOg1CNPkqQ), I broke from my trend of looking forward and give a glance to my past.  It is a rock representation of titles that once played a role in my life for workouts.  In turn, I applied the queue in these last six weeks EXCLUSIVELY during my bag training.  The roster has its own narrative to share as it plays out my life 20 to 25 years ago (1995-2000) while also being double-threaded with ages 20 to 25 (July '98 to July '04).  Perhaps more of an erudite approach than what is necessary for smashing a bag (or a pumpkin for that matter), but nevertheless, it works for me and I work from it.
