Matching its 70 F forecast, yesterday was an absolutely gorgeous, sunny day, especially as we are approaching Christmas.  It was a time I had been looking forward to all week.  I went outside, cranked up the tunes (the rock yacht-laden [The 13th Expedition playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0UnJgMC8zuXeya4cXF0PTM?si=NHtuw2xSScOYTYf2XUI5rQ)) and...wielded my sledgehammer like Thor!  OK, so *most* of my time was spent with a crowbar, but C'MON you WANT images of Chris Hemsworth over Joe Pesci's *Home Alone*!

Through the sheer willpower of these two hands, my workout that day was a few hours invested in tearing down the outdoor deck.  My approach so far has been to preserve what wood I can in case I want to create something, though my recent return to...well, I don't want to necessarily say *minimalism*, I might call it optimization...well, my recent shift to *whatever* puts me at a crossroads:  do I take the wood and define 2021 by craftsmanship and subsequently all of the new tools and upkeep required?  Or, do I set ablaze the wood and get rid of the tools I already have and maintain my workout space for 2021? 

I do enjoy woodworking, but I don't enjoy its scope creep: space, time, money, etc.  Among the hobbies, I would think its the most needy, a gadget here; stains and oils there; clamps-a-plenty; and not to mention the workspace cleaning and filtering requirements!  I don't think its payoff is worth all the money I've sunk into it already, so why keep chasing good money after bad? Perhaps I could be persuaded to continue if my soul was not of a *[Ramblin' Man](https://open.spotify.com/track/5cfYurP1XKldMBtvBBJiTs?si=gKrK0IxNQ-S82mX2VHYwPQ)*.

No, my time is better spent at building me.
