While far from where I want the stable design, I whipped together a stylesheet for this site. I know, it looks a lot like my old one, and while its based off the prior synthwave vibe, it's new! Sometimes you just gotta reset things to bring some fresh energy into the room.

I look forward to laying out my new fitness program...I have NO idea what the sweat equity might entail, but I like the optimization of the diet, something I considered after consuming Taubes' *The Case Against Sugar*. Basically, I'm just cutting sugar out of my diet, insofar the kind of stuff that's not found out in the wild....which isn't as forthcoming as I'd like as it can be hidden by 60-something portrayals, but the basic gist is agave, malt, syrup, sugar, juice, caramel, corn sweetener, dextrin, dextrose, fructose, glucose, HFCS, honey, maltol, mannose, molasses, muscovado, panocha, saccharose, sucrose, and treacle ([source](https://sugarscience.ucsf.edu/hidden-in-plain-sight/)).

My basic strategy is to reduce sugars thereby not requiring as much insulin which in turn, doesn't get in the way of hormones for resource allocation. While I have my base level of meals to make sure I capture maximum nutrition, I'm not so hardcore calorie-centric. This is especially notable as in these early stages, if I'm hungry beyond my meal plan, I have the freedom to eat 6 oz of beans or whatever. This softer stance has kept the binges at bay.

While I don't see much room for a significant weightloss outcome than what I've done in the past, I think I have stumbled on a way to not go nuts when I do go off my diet or more importantly, what do I do once I reach goal weight.

Tonight, I glide across a desolate night drive passing the neon borders outlining the shadows of midnight blues.
