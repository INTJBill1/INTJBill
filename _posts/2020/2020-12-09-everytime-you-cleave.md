While my wife has given me a treasure hoard of candles, some 21 jars at 18 oz each, the newest scent in the house is the best: bacon.  

Sure, my time as a carnivore has basically been beef atop more beef; using bacon (with no sugar) as more of an accent to my meal wasâ€”well, it was bacon, I don't need to paint the picture for you!  That said, once the bacon grease had solidified, it was outstanding to spread a tablespoon+ of it atop my beef patties for lunch.

Add that to a ribeye treat last night and I gotta admit: I am **lovin'** my diet.  I took a quick peek at my weight the other day and I lost ANOTHER 4 lbs since the last weigh-in on Dec 3rd, putting me at 233.  But that's the last time I'm weighing in until January 14th!  Well...I'll post something about it on New Year's Eve.

I brought back and updated [the weightloss table](/fit/#all-results) I once maintained on WordPress.  My transition from keto to carnivore on November 23 was well-timed.

I've been feeling good, perhaps *too good*.  After healing up from the right lat issue, I began hauling one deck railing on my shoulder and dragged backwards another section, up a hill AND *back* down again after finding a better burn spot.  Taking a breather by raking leaves, I then pulled together all the wood and got a fire going.  Watching the fire burn, I used a crowbar to pull 4 deck planks up and found my forearms to be fatiguing on me, so I shut things down and shelved the crowbar and sledgehammer.  Returning to the fire, I thought I could just give one good yank to get the 5th plank up with my bare hands.  For a moment, it felt like it gave...turns out something in my spine moved for my lower back locked up like nobody's business!  So, here I am again, shuffling my feet around, cursing I didn't spend more time in my deadlift dumbbell routine.

The weird thing is that while I've got this new back thing, I really want to work out and move.  If I'm this way at 233...it's lining up to be a SPECTACULAR 2021.
