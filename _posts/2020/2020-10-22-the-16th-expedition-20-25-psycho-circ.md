The 15th Expedition's results are in: I lost **11 ¾ lbs**! Now at 244, I updated the graph on the [Fit](/fit/) page

The results aren't too shabby considering I only began daily training in the last couple of weeks and I continue with eggs, meat, the occasional butter, and the weekly SPAM!

That said, I did experiment with having more carbs in my diet by revisiting a low-calorie vegetarian approach, but ultimately its risk:benefit ratio was too high.  Additionally, I shelved the Bulletproof Coffee.

The last 42 day averages:

* Calories: 1956.2
* Total Carbs (g): 24
* Net Carbs (g): 11.8
* Fat (g): 138.4
* Protein (g): 152

To put it into perspective, my diet yesterday was typical to my carnivore approach:

* Calories: 1928
* Total Carbs (g): 9 
* Net Carbs (g): 9
* Fat (g): 126
* Protein (g): 178

Chiefly—and this must not be understated: I am winning the battle against *The Bump*, that is the momentarily lapse that leads to MONTHS of weight gain; it's all there in the weight graph!  This time around, I've made it through The 13th, 14th, 15th, and now enter 16th...I've never made it successfully through a fourth expedition in a row, but I feel absolutely confident its happening.

I've just got to refine my music selection for The 16th Expedition and it'll be ready—lemme tell ya, there's ABSOLUTELY NO WAY I can lapse on my fitness with THIS playlist.  I'm building it to be the perfect OST to my striking sessions.

The 16th Expedition: 20⚡25...LET IT BEGIN!
