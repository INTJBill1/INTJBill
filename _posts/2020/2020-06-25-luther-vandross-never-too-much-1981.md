A 3AM something morning...glistening with sweat...the counterbalancing timing of arms and legs volleying fireworks of activity across the span of the corpus callosum...I make my return to my workshop. OK, so it is an odd space with revealing parallels to my mind: in one sphere, there's the dusty woodworking tools piled atop the workbench I built back in 2016; an over-represented health sector; a wild flurry of kid disorientation marking its own ragged confines; a cost-saving and audiobook opportunity, ordered clothesline paralleling the southwestern wall; a poster from Stranger Things 3; and a telescope that floats across space. And lest I forget, an armful-sized Maui from *Moana* cheering on with his The Rock efficacious exultation.

In my return to my 3AM something morning, I couldn't match past efforts, whether qualitatively or quantitatively—it wasn't the point; those parameters will be defined in time. No, I HAD to get out there to begin the daily deposits to unleash compounding, ESPECIALLY as I learn further from Perlmutter's *Grain Brain: The Surprising Truth about Wheat, Carbs, and Sugar—Your Brain's Silent Killers*, as it illustrates how a low carb diet and an exercise regimen further develop our mind. Speaking of cognitive expansion, I actually do add carbs into my diet, specifically 2 tablespoons of cacao powder because of research: (1) [The neuroprotective effects of cocoa flavanol and its influence on cognitive performance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3575938/); (2) [Steady State Visually Evoked Potential (SSVEP) Topography Changes Associated With Cocoa Flavanol Consumption](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22120044/) et al.

Sure, I want ripped abs, but I *long* for an approaching-infinity pack cerebellum...\*shrug\*...it's the best I can do until they upload my consciousness in Michio Kaku's futurism.
