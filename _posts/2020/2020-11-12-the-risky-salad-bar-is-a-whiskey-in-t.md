It is now just a few hours into the 2nd half of the current expedition.  As such, to evade paralysis by analysis, I'm not going to peek at the scale any longer—it's how I used to approach my weightloss; the Expedition's weigh-ins were it! 

Furthermore, while I still have plenty of months left on my Cronometer membership, as of today, I've quit updating it.  To use it as a primary thrust requires faith to apply assumptions:  

1. How much confidence can I have that the data are true and the foods I eat are equivalent?  
2. Can I trust that the RDAs are valid for a 5'9, 240 lb, 42-year-old man who trains 6 days a week?  
3. How well does my body absorb the nutrients in spinach or whatever?
4. Does my microwaving and dehydrating wipe out things like its Vitamin C?  

Ultimately, if I'm lowering caloric intake to the point where I get just enough of whatever is the lowest 100% nutrient, can I trust it?  Can I go hungry and have the mental confidence that I'm 100% provided for?

What was the problem I had with this high nutrient, low-calorie, plant-based et al diet?   It was *The Bump*, what I reference as once I'm off the diet, my weight skyrockets up the scale.  The diet is not sustainable.  It's a lot of external monitoring.

So, I'm off the scale and I'm off the calorie computer.  I remain off the carbs as well—even more so as I'm heeding the threat of *Total* Carbs. 

While I have this 1lb of meat with 3-ish eggs goal a day, I'm letting my appetite direct my intake.  I start this morning off with 16 oz of coffee with 1 tbsp of Kerrygold butter and another tbsp of MCT.  Yes, it's a couple of items from plants, but this is a meat-based diet, not a strictly-meat diet!  I really want to avoid the cult-like behavior that some diet adherents proselytize.  Sorry folks, I remain unlabeled!

I like the idea of having the fundamentals in my head and just wing it.  If I am focused on the exact nutrition all-the-time, that means that I'm focused on food all-the-time, which means that I'm like to eat or want to eat all-the-time.  Willpower to fight off desire is in a limited quantity. 

I'd rather be in the position where I need a reminder to eat (and enjoy what I consume).
