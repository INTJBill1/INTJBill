2021 is ever so close...can you feel it?

This morning, I trained in my garage for it. From past workouts, I suppose I got in there kind of late at 5AM, but it was GOOD to finally return to that space, 100% and ready to rock! I put in an hour of cardio on the treadmill with walking and a little bit of running followed by some bagwork and bodyweight circuits. While it was easy to do with my lighter frame, I want to be sensitive to my left foot—it feels fine, but I know it was been a trouble spot in the past and I didn't want a 0-60 ramp up to blow a gasket!

Of course, I say, "lighter frame," but it's NOWHERE near where I want to be. But, the experience felt lighter than the last time I trained in November, back when I had The Beard. Oh, don't worry, The Beard will be back. I just wanted a restart with the upcoming year so that I have have a starting line.

Oh yeah—my new place online! OK, so it looks a LOT like the old place, but it's a whole different platform than GitHub. I just keep dragging this theme along with me and adapting it as I go. This time around, I really wanted something that was easier to read, yet not too far off from what I've been doing. I have no idea what my users experience, but I know for me, my astigmatism plays mind games on me. Yet, my world remains unframed!
