No surprise at this point, but I'm coming off another GREAT workout session! The 50% increase striking workout exploded off successfully.  There's so much more that I want to implement—it feels *good* to be excited about each upcoming session!

I'm *so* glad I returned to the carnivore approach!  My breakfast as I type this is an *eat until full and save the rest for later* approach to 1 lb of ground beef and six eggs.  I fried up the ground beef in its own juices and after its browning, I removed it, and scrambled up the eggs into what remained—no waste!  

After plating the eggs, I then just plop the beef right on top. I like meat to be as dry as possible—I am a jerky man at the end of the day, which always made those vegan days of old so challenging, so extracting the additional grease to be used for eggs was a win.  Now, I prefer my eggs to be brown, but that's harder to pull off with that much fat!

Typically, I'll skip breakfast in lieu of a cup of coffee, but since (for now) that's not in my diet, I thought I'd dive right in ESPECIALLY as I was really hungry after a powerful workout that was "fueled" by my reaction to MiO Energy Green Thunder's 0 calorie water enhancer and its 360 mg of caffeine followed by its dumping of B3, B6, and B12 into my system.

If you think its a rich breakfast, you'd be right!  The amounts are generally my goal for the entire day.   But the funny thing, is that if you're into counting calories, it's FAR more satisfying than the equivalent carbs.  There will be no desire for lunch either, compared to the ball-and-chain that is carbs.
