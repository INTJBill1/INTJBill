I celebrate my 1 month anniversary of carnivore today! I *feel* absolutely fantastic!  Sadly, I haven't had a SINGLE gym session this entire month!  I mean, there have been times when I had those "outdoor workouts" as I returned to the ancient fascination with fire, but there have been no hikes or runs along the way...I maybe spent 5 minutes hitting the bag, but that's just because I enjoy it!  Of course, I'm losing weight and my training time isn't about that despite that being the go-to of most—I used to watch SEASONS of *The Biggest Loser* and know how that narrative plays out.

Weightloss simply is not a calorie-in / calorie-out dynamic.  Here's something we knew since we were teenagers:  hormones determine body composition.

My diet remains basic.  What I like about it, among other things, is its authenticity.  Whoever sold the idea of having a *balanced* diet could sell...well, lemme bundle his description with some George Strait:

> I've got some ocean front property in Arizona   
> From my front porch, you can see the sea   
> I've got some ocean front property in Arizona   
> If you'll buy that,   
> I'll throw the Golden Gate in free  

Observe for a moment:  where is nature's buffet? Does a tiger slash its way through a corn field?  Does a cow pounce upon a chicken? Do pandas smoke ribs?  Does a bear and an ant switch plates to hit their Recommended Dietary Allowance? No, animals eat what they want and as much as they want as it is available.  They don't pull out their iPhones to run the calculations.

Of course, we're fortunate that we CAN eat grass and leaves in case a hunt goes empty.  It's not optimal for we're simply not equipped with ruminant stomachs and the bacteria therein—we've LITERALLY got hydrochloric acid in our single stomach!

And frankly, while most plants we CANNOT eat, we basically can eat EVERY animal with the exception of...maybe a puffer fish?  Think about that for a moment the next time you walk through a forest and wonder if that berry will kill you, while knowing that random squirrel cooked over a fire served with that fish over in the pond would be tasty dinner in the wild...but that hunk of grass at my feet, even if I *could* eat it, I think I'd pass.
