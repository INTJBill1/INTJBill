It's Sunday as I enter my very sorely needed rest day!  Hopefully the minor dings I received last week will be buffed out today.  Honestly, I felt a bounce in my step this morning and longed to GO, GO, GO, but these days are integral to my success, EVEN if my spirit wants to skip them...nevertheless, tomorrow must wait.

The future that lies ahead:  I envision a 2021 that I wanted for 2015.  Back then, I had this mindset that I would train and run a race every month as a motivator.  Yet, as I prepared, personal tragedy struck and I chose to go into a tailspin for the year and never implemented that plan.  I shelved it for another time.  

Yet, the game plan remains and something I desire.  CLEARLY, its been in my mind for years now.  Now, why didn't I do it in 2018, 2019 or 2020? I always had this idea of "get me get down to goal wait and *then* rock out." And yet, it can be a part of the process as well and make for points of comparison as I drop weight and improve stamina.  

And while there's a part of me that wants to get *better* before then, I get to have a chance for that as well as I'm thinking either March or April for its kickoff, as that would give me 4 to 5 months of prep time when I hope all these little dings will be the idiosyncrasies of the past. 

As it has been said, "Because tomorrow the sun will rise. Who knows what the tide could bring?"
