I track daily my nutritional intake with [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/)â€”great site, can't recommend it enough!  Today, I decided to run the numbers between *The 14th Expedition* and *The 15th* since they were comparable both with weightloss results (about 12 lbs), activity level and diet approach, save some adjustments I had made.

Interesting stuff, despite the same results, *The 14th's* daily averages to my most recent 6-weeks are:

* Calories: **+**579 kcal
* Carbs: **+**11 g
* Net Carbs: **+**2 g
* Fat: **+**74 g
* Protein: **-**24 g 

The biggest change from 14 to 15 was that I had reduced or removed entirely my focus on fat with cheese, coconut oil and butter, specifically with Bulletproof coffee.  Though I written about the farce that is our culture's goal of calorie reduction, I fell into the same trap myself, thinking if I took one thing out, I'd have an edge.

By that logic, I *should* have lost an additional 7 lbs...**HOWEVER, there was no effect!**  Sure, a pound lost at 160 is wholly different than 260, but there's only a minor difference between 267 and 255.

So where do I go from here?  Remember and recognize that my body chooses what should stay and what should go.  While I still believe there's a correlation with calories, ultimately our bodies attempt to achieve homeostasis, when it chooses to rid itself of excess fat, it will.  In the meantime, I'll continue to avoid non-contributing carbs and demand more from my body in the gym.

So, it's back to my luxurious butter and coconut oil coffee in the morning! Flax seeds, sunflower seeds and more!
