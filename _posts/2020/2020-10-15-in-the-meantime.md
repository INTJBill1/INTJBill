I had an ABSOLUTELY fantastic workout this morning!  I even ran the last 10 minutes of the 120 minute session despite saying earlier that I wasn't going to run the rest of the year to avoid injury.  I just *wanted* it.  

Additionally, I'm going to have to up my bag time.  I've been doing 2 minutes on and 30 seconds off for 10 sets, however, I may try out a 50% increase with 15 sets, for today I had plenty left in my tank.  I need to better define the details of each set for I don't do the same thing each time, whether a specific combo or switching stances or technique. I never feel I have enough time to put the work in!

This week, I've been hitting the bag to Spotify's [This is Demon Hunter playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX78sIttQ9N5X?si=Cs1-SOIhRoChOa_oe62iqQ).  The songs are no good for a coffeehouse, but perfect to *Hulk Smash*!

I am *really* looking forward to 2021.  Of course, it assumes that I keep rocking out these workouts and continue to Eat of the Hunter's Feat as I Parry the Parry the Corrupted Carb!

It hit me hard this morning that I am **so tired** of excess weight—it's not for your go-to reason; it's not because of aesthetics.  I **HATE** that excess weight holds back my performance!  I cannot push as hard as I like, run as fast, be as quick, or strike as agile—the list goes on and on.   I'm training now to have that in 2021.
