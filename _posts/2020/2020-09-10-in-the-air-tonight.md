Another Expedition has come to a close; a new Expedition begins.  Hello The 15th Expedition:  may you exceed in value above all prior Expeditions!

How did The 14th Expedition fare?

I lost 12 lbs!

Of course, both of these Expeditions were in a context without regular (mostly none) of daily workouts.  While I had planned a reduction of fat grams, I was surprised that they actually went *up*.  The elevated total carbs are due to an experiment with flaxseed and broccoli, though I don't buy that net carbs cancel out total carbsâ€”there's a diminished relationship there, though who's to say what happens exactly?  So, I dialed back my flax seed consumption from 5 tbsp highs.

Emotionally, I cannot say I'm stoked with a 2 lb per week average, though that's the prevailing advice of *healthy* weightloss.  Clearly without working out and literally eating pork, eggs, butter and cheese everyday, weightloss comes easy.

But, I like popping the *BIG NUMBERS!*

Thus, 2 lbs /week is the baseline, what I lose by doing nothing other than...well, I can't even say I hit my gram goals, though I'm happy with the macros.  

Beyond the scale, what did The 14th bring me?

While The 13th Expedition introduced innovation, The 14th reviewed everything under a critical eye.

I like the rollout of [Software Standards](/geek/standards/). In like fashion, I'm re-examining my media consumption, specifically podcasts and books.  I recognized I've handled that area of my life as an All-You-Can-Eat buffet, as I'm now adopting an All-You-CARE-to Eat approach.

For the 15th, I'm pouring on a big ol' serving of workouts on to plate!  I've never outperformed a consecutive Expedition before, and it's time for that! More about that in the future...
