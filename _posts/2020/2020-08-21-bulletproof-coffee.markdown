Playing off my post title from yesterday, I now use the *Toy Story*-inspired category for this new era of writing:  To Infinity and Beyond!  It feels peculiar to purposely move beyond *The Expeditions*. Sure, I'd go on a long, food binge and set them aside for a season, but, when I'm actively pursuing fitness, it's something new to abandon an approach I've been doing since April 2018.

And I welcome the move as I suspect it'll charge up innovation for more changes.

For the last week or so, I've finally gone full-throttle on Bulletproof Coffee.  Sure, I've been doing butter & coconut oil for sometime as my breakfast.  However, only recently did I make the leap into MCT oil and using Kerrygold grassfed butter **AND I LOVE IT**!  Now, I'm not the type to say that you ought to know the first crush along with of the other backstory of my meat, but, I gotta admit, grassfed butter just tastes better.  Add a tbsp of that and another of MCT oil into 12 oz. of dark roast coming out of a French press, and you've got one succulent morning brew.  Run it back a second time and you'll have no desire to eat until lunchâ€”DESPITE skipping last night's dinner!  And you'll have a mind pulsating with electrical activity!
