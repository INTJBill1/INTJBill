I've got a new tool I'm going to try out during my Monday morning workout: a metronome.  It occurred to me the other day as I shadowboxed out of necessity as my MMA gloves are too light for the heavy bag and tears my knuckles up as I Rocky my morning.

I was doing it to a synthwave playlist and it matched up to my strikes.  I suspect a metronome would match up nicely to that activity along with a host of others.  

I do this one exercise where the whole movement is basically a core workout, something akin to blocking and striking at the same time without any sort of extension:

* Left forearm strike to the top 
* Right upwards elbow strike to the torso
* Left upwards elbow strike to the torso
* Right forearm strike to the top

After the interval set/rest, I'll flip to southpaw and repeat—anyway, all of that would work great to the rhythm of a metronome. They're easy to find.  As I don't want it to mess up my music or HIIT counter, I can bring a laptop into the workout and just google "metronome" and BAM Google provides one.

I remain brainstorming a new iron-less workout.  I've only been putting in an hour each day, as I've put much more time into 1) daily meditation and 2) visualization mediation—20 minutes each!

Thus, I'm mindmapping something together.  To kickoff a fresh start, I've abandoned my old friend of Freemind and downloaded a free copy of [XMind](https://www.xmind.net/).

When I have something in place, I'm sure to post it on this site, though this site could very well be hosted on GitHub Pages by then.  I remain researching a way I can best integrate it.  I'm beginning to really enjoy Markdown.  

I *may* return to Facebook toward the end of this year, if for anything else, to catch up with old friends and play Mark Morrison's [Return of the Mack](https://open.spotify.com/track/3jDdpx9PMlfMBS5tOBHFm9?si=vUV7dAlyTmybIoqpE6mFAA) (*OK, so that song just happens to be playing as I typing to the Billboard Hits of 1997*).
