Yay!  I had a *great* workout this morning.  My ankle gave me just enough of an opening to lay in some good work before closing the opportunity again.

MOST importantly, I had my first running session!

What does it look like this morning?

Toward the end of the 3AM hour, I went out with a University of Memphis hoodie against the chill, a Mio Energy Thunder infused water and a tumbler replete with a couple of cups of coffee brew.

I did...

* a 10-minute walking warmup
* 6 sets of 3:00 - 1:00 running - walking intervals
* a cooldown / walking
* 15 sets of 3:00 - 1:00 striking - heartrate - crosstraining including ab work on an exercise ball and a 3-minute session on a vertical climber

While I have yet to establish 3 weekly runs with 1 long run on the weekends, it was AWESOME to take the first step in that direction.  It wasn't a spectacular run of course—how *could* it be? In this section of my training, it is critical just to step out and start the habit, the mindset of training toward an event.  It *really* drives home the importance of weightloss as something more than merely aesthetics, but to compete.

I'm continuing to explore methods and apps that might aid me—I really could use something to hold my phone! I find that that the *Zombies, Run!* app to be amusing.  In time, I'll find the ideal equipment, shoes, tech that will help me become a better athlete.

Wow...*athlete*.  I haven't called myself by that in *years*.  Things are changing, folks.  Stay tuned!
