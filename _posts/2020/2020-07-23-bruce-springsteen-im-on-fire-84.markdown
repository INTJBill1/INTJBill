I know, I know, I said I wasn't going to workout until the outset of The 14th Expedition, but I began on Tuesday. It was from a few things: 1) I just felt the desire; 2) my new usage of [Habitca](https://www.habitica/) promotes the behavior; and 3) when one feels the wave of momentum, you gotta ride it through.

The desire I feel shouldn't come off as a surprise for its a natural evolution of a calorie-unrestricted, 30 total carbs diet. It asks me to take it out for a spin, so I oblige.

And when I feel the momentum of something good taking place, why fight it, ESPECIALLY just because some calendar says something different? Dates can be changed with a couple of clicks, especially in context with positive results.

Gamification is a key for my success. When I've been able to apply it in areas of my life, no matter what era, I've found success. In this instance with Habitca, I find its snappy interface and RPG elements to be delightful. The developers use of color as it relates to activity is just smart. I like smart things! While I'm largely indifferent to its use socialization, attributable to being an INTJ more than anything else—it's why my favorite World of Warcraft class was the [me party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXH3Gnvxpw0) of a hunter and his pet—I'd welcome people with a similar drive as mine. And hey, I would no longer be roaring venomous invective at these Feral Dust Bunnies that I've been fighting these past couple of days!

Of course, I gotta always ask those "why" or "to what end" questions even to a well-developed SMART goal. So, when I considered what Habits, Dailies, and To Do's, I want them to lead toward a overarching goal instead of deriving value in of themselves (or the pleasure of accomplishing the process). I won't lie: I find a tweak of happiness when I check off a goal, but, if that goal has no purpose…

I do like that Habitica gave me a challenge that features these two To Do items:

> **1. Brainstorm different topics that interest you**
>
>What are some things you aren't already an expert in, but which sound intriguing to you? What have you always wanted to read up on, but haven't taken the time? Think of a few such areas of knowledge and write them down!
>
>**2. Pick one topic to delve into this month**
>
>Once you've completed the "Brainstorm different topics" To-Do, look at your list and pick one of the areas of interest to focus on this month. Which do you feel has the richest potential for growing your knowledge right now? Go for it!
