Yesterday, I considered bringing coffee back into the carnivore lineup.  Abandoning the trail map of all my past, resolute footsteps, I was unsure if I really wanted to leave my coffee companion behind. Yet, in that hesitant sip from a mug artfully designed with Starbuck's Memphis, I found all the reasons why I should not pour a second cup for the rest of 2020. My stomach bemoaned the bitter brew, no longer tempered by Kerrygold!

That was that, full speed aheadâ€”so I thought.  However, the end of the day marked the return of beef jerky and Diet Coke, as I fell backward off the climb.  Now, you might think that this isn't a big infraction, but I'm beginning to put more stock that in how the taste of sweetness affects my mind and in turn my body.  Look, there's always a balance that occurs, if my body doesn't react to sweetness than why do I want it in the first place?  Payoffs gotta be paid.

Thus, today, I shake the dirt off and clap vigorously my hands together.  I'm abandoning my desire for sweetness.  I've got this.

2021 is coming.
