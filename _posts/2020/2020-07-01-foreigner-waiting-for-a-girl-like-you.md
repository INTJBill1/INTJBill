Shrouded by a torrent of rainfall throughout the night, we make landfall upon July's beach of dark skies as echoes of adventure drum its quickened tempo of progression. These are not the days to slide into the dementia of the sea, but to crash our hammers onto the annals of our timeline. These are the celestial days between what is and what shall be. Go forth, for these are the days of Avalon!

Therefore, drop that *Cold-Forged Breastplate of the Banished* and *Leather Wraps of Doomed Dreams*. Equip your *Stormguard's Adamantite* *Tunic of Fury* and *Conqueror's Gloves of the Tiger*.

Abandon that most foul *Longbow of Putrid Paragon* and raise your *Blade of Oblivion's Call of Light's Hope*...

...for tonight, we ride!
