It's the first full day since returning to my retro diet and I *feel fantastic!*  OK, so yesterday could have been the first day, but the insight didn't hit me until *after* I had a MCT/butter coffee.  Of course, it's too soon to make commentary on energy levels, but if I experience what I did in 2018 and 2019, I should not feel any drop in my workouts with the reduced caloric intake.

I return to [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) after spending most of October and then some on Habitica.  Again, while I like the *idea* of Habitica, its gamification execution fails to pass the starting levelâ€”I've written enough about that already in past posts!  Oh, disappointment!  As far as actual needs go, I just want something that I can quickly jot into as a reminder before my thoughts move on to something else.  OK, *maybe* there's something more to it...
