I ABSOLUTELY loved the night sky this morning!   It was a surreal experience, like I was in a video game.  In such a backdrop, I wanted to get in my truck, queue up some retrowave on Spotify and drive into the night.

Nevertheless, this beast from the *Creatures of the Night* had to enter his sixth training session to close out the week.   

The workout was good, though I had to shave an additional 5 minutes out of its ending, just as I have for the past three days because of my ankle.  Good opening cardio; *great* bagwork and exercise ball reps; and when I pushed to close out with additional cardio, minutes in, the ankle aches began.  While I'll happily take the 2 1/4 hour workout, I *really* wanted to return to and go beyond 150 minutes.

In time.  **2021**: we'll be running those races.

For now, **November**:  Let's Do This!
