I've got less than 13 days before I weigh for *The 15th Expedition*.  In roughly 83 days, I'll be returning to Facebook, marking the gateway to 2021.

I won't get to goal weight in 12 weeks.  And honestly, it's not important that I do or even that I drop below the 200 threshold, for this isn't a one-shot deal.  I'm framing everything I do in context to 2021 and everything I want out of it!

2020 has not been about optimizing weightloss but mitigating the threat of those weight gain *bumps* that are along for the ride.  

The bump is the killer.  I can lose weight: since New Year's Eve 2017, I've lost 305 lbs; HOWEVER during that same span, I gained 229.  Sure, the net remains in my favor, but I should already be done with this phase of my fitness—gain, it's why I underscore the need to resolve the bump!

Keto is a great long-term solution for that outcome.  Does it mean giving up ice cream, pecan pie, fried pies, doughnuts Snicker bars, and fast food?  Absolutely.   And it's worth the trade off!

Up until now I haven't referenced it, however, in the short-term, I've been on a carnivore diet—well, a carnivore diet with artificial sweeteners, so a bit of a clashing between two worlds.  No dairy!  

It's been just meat, eggs, coconut oil, and literally gallons of Jell-o—or to be more accurate, unflavored gelatin that I customize.  Instead of being tempted by an afternoon raid of my raw sunflower seed stash, I just go to the gelatin I have on hand to nix the craving.  I eat literally 4 to 8 cups of gelatin a day (one packet of gelatin makes 2 cups).  There's been a lot of ground beef in my life, sometimes mixed with chicken liver, and on some mind-blowing days, I've had a sardine omelet.  

Yeah, I've made a sharp teeth departure from those vegan days of mine!

I've been hyped up on the Mio Energy Green Thunder after we picked up 100+ at a closeout price of $0.25 each (it typically runs $3/each).  It likely led to my *Leeroy Jenkins* approach  to Monday's morning training that led to the leg injury, something that I *think* is now in the rear view mirror, as I spent a couple hours this morning with cardio (though light jogging had a few snags, so it's ruled out).
