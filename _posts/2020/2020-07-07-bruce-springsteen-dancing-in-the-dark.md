I am absolutely stoked: for my upcoming birthday, I received a sleep mask headphones with bluetooth technology! I've been wanting it since April when I heard from it from Ferriss' *Tribe of Mentors*—OK, my skimming of the book. After awhile, the message the author seemingly tries to bring home is 1) be a Buddhist; 2) do his hobbies; and 3) here's some random stuff from the best click-bait people he could find. It wasn't exactly the cream of current cognition, but, to be fair, I wouldn't know where to start and definitely not in the confines of a popular audience. And honestly, if we are to write on what we know, how can I fault the author? Maybe the book's title implies something more grandiose? Then again, some tribes just wipe out other tribes. <*shrug*>

Nevertheless, I did mine the book for nuggets and unearthed the headphone sleep mask!

At this point, like everybody else, I love music, so there's that concept for sleep mask application. However, I've also been experimenting with binaural beats as a soundtrack of my meditative space, not unlike focusing on my breath. Now with the sleep mask, I suppose it comes a little bit like Eleven from *Stranger Things*. You can be sure if I can find the gate to another dimension, I'll post a blog on it, or at least find the me on the other side to cross the divide and post—assuming of course he's not wearing a goatee to add to his crazy eyes (*ST:TOS*) or has WAY over-the-top behavior while hopped up on a full 64 oz cup of Mountain Dew salaciousness (*ST:DS9*) or is just too busy at the pool building his Americana army (*Stranger Things*). Honestly, I'm convinced that instead of doubling back in a linear context, when my Future Me swings by in our DeLorean, he won't be from my universe, but, "I" will shatter through the membrane between universes in all 88 mph glory!
