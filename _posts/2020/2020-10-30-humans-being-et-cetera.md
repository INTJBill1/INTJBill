I am feeling **FANTASTIC**—or perhaps, I'm influenced by my return to 7 cups of coffee a day! While the carnivore diet was the sexier approach, my retro diet puts me in a better place—no nausea—and also encourages an intermittent fasting approach.  PLUS, I couldn't find confidence in an approach that actively brushes RDAs aside as something only glucose gluttons have to meet.  And I very could be wrong on this point, but if I'm not confident in it, I won't perform to my potential.  Honestly, I like fiber...even if its from the rags of Egypt!

Finally, there may be something flawed with the idea that I can eat whenever I *feel* hungry and in that, whatever I want as long as there's no carbs.  I mean, it seems like a plausible approach until I realize that feelings should be used as a catalyst and not as a metric.  Feelings drove some bad eating habits in the past. 

Not that weight can't be lost going carnivore, but I get the impression that I just do *far* better on my retro diet—historically anyway!  I mean, we'll see come December 3, but it's an easy bet it'll be far more than 12 lbs or the percentage equivalent of the past couple of Expeditions.

And *The Bump*...well, that's the focus of the fearmonger...

*I just can't stop.* 

This week's workout winds down tomorrow and it looks like I'm going to limp into my REST day on Sunday.  Ah, it's my left ankle this time...the last couple of  2 1/2 hour sessions had to be cut short by 5-10 minutes because of an aching ankle.  I dealt with it from 40 minutes in which led to some novel training solutions.  It's always something...

*I just can't **BE** stopped.*
