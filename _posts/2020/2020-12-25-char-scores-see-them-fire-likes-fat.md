Merry Christmas!  I decided to stick with GitHub as my webhost as a present to myself!  Flat files are really the way to go when it comes to preserving content through the years.  Even file formats come and go in popularity, but txt has always been txt as these decades have passed (even extension-less).  And hey, I spent $10.51 on my hosting in 2019; for 2021, I can keep that in my pocket!  It's not entirely free since I still have to pay for the domain name each year, but you can see why I bristle at paying $5/month for email service for a custom domain with places like ProtonMail. 

Speaking of content, I'm bringing back all of my old stuff EVEN though there's just a hint of a bittersweet undertone as I recognize I've lost YEARS of writing (including 2019).  And while there never is anything prodigious in my content, there's a LOT I lost in the hard drive crash coming back down from Alaska including the journal I kept daily during my first trip to Europe in 2004.

Of course, there's not much value beyond my dialog of the things that were, for these things that once mattered now host dust bunnies playing racquetball on Friday nights.

And while I don't want to get to ahead of myself and enjoy today, the pinnacle of the season, I admit: I'm EXCITED for New Year's Eve!!  Like any good, little INTJ, I'm carefully crafting my resolutions for 2021!  I'll be posting things on here before the clock hits 12!
