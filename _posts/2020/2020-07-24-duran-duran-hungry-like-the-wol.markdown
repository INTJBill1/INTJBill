Admittedly, my sudden ramp-up of physical activity has caused all the fun that you might expect from a 0-to-60 explosion of iron. I still need to sit back and examine how different exercises promote my destination—YES, I suppose you can't go wrong with an increased amount of physical exercise, but does a resistance program match up with what I want?

I want enhanced dexterity, agility, and stamina. Do weights promote that? —bodyweight, sure, but, I never go away from my dumbbells feeling more adroit. Hulk smash, yes. But, your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man? I don't need spidey sense to answer that!

No, while I've done my share of DB sets, ultimately, I'm going to have to replace them with something far more pragmatic. Visualization/meditation, yoga, martial arts, body weight training, and cardio equipment make sense.

Look, if all of these workouts are about optimizing my body's ability, then I should focus on optimizing my body's ability. Fitness isn't about profile pictures.
