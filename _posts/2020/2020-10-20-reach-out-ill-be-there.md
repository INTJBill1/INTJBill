Fall 2020 is a special time for me.  Sure, I've written on my love for the fall, a delight that is only second to the Christmas season and the buildup to the new year.  This fall season is especially welcomed as its the 20th anniversary of that tempestuous Fall 2000, where *everything* had to be broken down before it could be built better.  It is also the 25th anniversary of the best shape I've ever been in my life, when I was a high school senior whom spent 150+ minutes a day M-F in wrestling practice.  In January 1996, I left it behind to begin Taekwondo....and I do look forward to 1996's 25th.  It is appropriate that I make my Facebook return this New Year's Eve.

None of it seems so long ago, yet there have been so many faces and so many places along the way.  

["It's been a long road, getting from there to here."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-inVvjyE7Fg)  And while the years have been many and the stories have unfurled, I don't feel like anyone else but me.  I've got scars and a propensity for particular injuries, but I'm no different than I was 20 or 25 years ago.  I've crammed more trivia into my head along the way, but I remain *me.*  I like that guy!
