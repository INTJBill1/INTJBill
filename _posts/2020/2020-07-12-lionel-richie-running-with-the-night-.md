Yesterday, after an unexplained two-day delay beyond the "out for delivery" post and after a call to FedEx, I received my order from Black Rifle Coffee Company. And while all the shipping hassle of my Saturday, July 4th's order, on Friday, July 10th, I enjoyed a noteworthy cup from its *[Murdered Out](https://www.blackriflecoffee.com/collections/extra-dark-roast/products/murdered-out-coffee-blend)* extra dark roast. However, I don't think I'll order it again unless BRCC gives its customers the option to choose USPS as a shipper. During the logistical limbo, I had the chance to try out other regional roasters

  * Memphis: J. Brooks Coffee Roasters: (1) [*Onyx*](https://www.jbrookscoffeeroasters.com/all-coffee/onyx) and (2) [*Spirit of Memphis*](https://www.jbrookscoffeeroasters.com/all-coffee/spirit-of-memphis)
  * Nashville: Drew's Brews: [*Lost Weekend*](https://www.drewsbrewscoffee.com/coffee/lost-weekend/)

Add the 3 bags from BRCC and 3 bags of the above, plus what's already on hand from [*Pablo's Pride*](https://donpablocoffee.com/product-category/pablos-pride/) purchased at Sam's Club, it'll be a little bit before I go shopping for whole beans again.

And I'm only drinking 36 oz a day! I'm trying to sqeeze in one more 12 oz, but I'm hitting the ceiling of my 30g total carb allotment.

Speaking of consumption, I am so very far from my past vegan and vegetarian ways. Sure, I love my pork rinds, a holdover from my dad, but, I did something I've never done before: I ate bones (provided freely by a local BBQ shack). In doing so, I felt like I was connecting with my ancestry, a time before tech's obfuscation of identity or even electricity for that matter. It wasn't quite as primal as you might think: after having a crockpot full of pork bones broken down for 24 hours for broth, a lot of the content can crumble in your fingers. The dark marrow tasted a lot like a grainy liver.
