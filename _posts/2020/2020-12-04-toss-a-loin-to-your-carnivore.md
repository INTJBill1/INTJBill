The 17th Expedition is upon me!  It's Day 2.  There was no post yesterday because there was no website.  I considered another WordPress return, but that transition is...well, not worth the time, an online journal as this is.  The great thing about Jekyll as a CMS is that I can leave and walk away with text files and not squeeze it out of a databaseâ€”and it's more legible than an HTML tag circus, too!

Before I move completely into The 17th, I'll share the results of The 16th Expedition: 7 lbs.  Yes, six-weeks of keto with some 1100 calorie misadventures thrown into the mix with workout session after workout session (before the core injury) and all I have to show for that 42-day span is SEVEN pounds.

It's not so bad...there's an asterisk here.

For the first 33 days, I lost 3 lbs.  I basically ran into a wall for the first 22 days of November. No change.

On November 23, I began eating beef when I was hungry and eventually took out coffee, butter, and even eggs.  Where did carnivore take me?  In 9 days, I lost 4 lbs.  I lost more weight as a carnivore in 9 days than I did in 33 with my prior approach!  And it wasn't like I took a binge break and was loaded with water weight!  

So, yesterday, I came in at 237, tying my lowest weight for 2020 on March 25 from a semi-starvation diet.  Now the question is: on December 30, will I suddenly weigh 40 lbs heavier, like what I did earlier this year on that 1000-1200 kcal diet, or did something fundamentally change with the approach I took after my lesson?  Stay tuned to find out on New Year's Eve!
