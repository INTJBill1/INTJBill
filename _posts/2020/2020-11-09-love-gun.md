After spending the weekend at parks toward investing in cardio and skipping out on the scheduled rest day, I didn't enter Monday's morning workout with fervor.  Indecisiveness was the order of the day: a quasi rest & train day.  I didn't like it, but I'm in a transition as I'm trying to figure out how to be a runner...and if I'm honest myself, I recognize that I'm *never* all something, but always a hybrid.  I didn't even wake up in the 3AM hour, but slept an hour further to heal the legs.  I got up, warmed up things, and went to work on the bag.  

Still, it wasn't a satisfying workout, though in comparison to going to a park, time in the gym isn't as motivating.

Honestly, I feel stagnant.  I don't feel my body changing and days are coming off a bit like *Groundhog Day*.  But, it's a matter of trusting the process, isn't it?  I do whatever I can now to contribute to a better position to kickoff 2021.

With 2020's sunset, the long shadows give chase as I search the horizon.
