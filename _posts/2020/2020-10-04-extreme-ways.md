While I woke up at 4 AM this Sunday morning unassisted, I knew that I needed more recovery time and fought my desire to work out. I *love* that space of my day and it's hard to give it up!

It's funny:  sometimes when we back off from something for a time, we forget how much we enjoy it.  How do we leave it in the first place?  In this context, I'm sure it was a late night followed by anotherâ€”maybe another *The Office* marathon via DVD, one thing supersedes another just because of the linearity of time.  Another example:  while I love audiobook consumption through Libby, lately, I've been listening/living in music. 

Of course, one *could* argue that nothing shuts down one of my workouts like an audiobook, so perhaps this isn't a neutral outcome.

Speaking about music motivation, I've been listening to Jason Bourne soundtracks to liven up an otherwise mundane existence.  I've always felt that way about those films ever since *The Bourne Identity* was released.  Do anything and it becomes epic when listening to a Bourne score.  You'll be flush with resolve and will be thinking 10 moves ahead.  Try it!  Even walking in a store!  You might even glance at your six.

Last week, I was caught up in the last soundtrack, *Jason Bourne* including another remix of the Moby classic.  While I plan on linking content that opens up a door into my work that motivates me, I'll include [my Bourne playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4O72SRmPc83ndAvMfzDMCu?si=t6aVJtVgRnmjHvx0Vtz_5A).
