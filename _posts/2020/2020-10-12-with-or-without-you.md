I'm making a dietary shift!  I'm setting aside the keto and carnivore applications that have fueled The 13th, 14th, and 15th Expeditions.  As The 16th nears with 10 days remaining, I'm going back to the evolving diet that gave me such success in 2018 and 2019.  

In this retro return, I am invigorated by everything I did on the diet in the past.  It's pumped full of nutrition and I never felt lousy eating it.   SURPRISE: eating boxed jello with artificial flavors and sweeteners along with an over-the-top amount of water *enhancers* will put a body in a tail spin!

After running the numbers, I realized that TODAY around noon, I will have broken my record for a diet streak: 116 days.  I did not know that at the outset of this post, but I guess on some subconscious level, I recognize a desire for change at the 116-day mark. Outstanding!  I really ought to do a better job of tracking that sort of thing.

As I'm closing in on 2021, I want to be more mindful of what I'm doing, and just wind up suddenly with weightloss, but can detail the steps that took me to get there, and more importantly, avoid the missteps that lead to gain.  Again, The Bump.

I'm not a proselyte to one particular system. There are all sorts of truth claims out there; people will pump their fists and rail for their side, but I have no allegiance to a caloric construct.  I want to have the optimal diet at the crossroads of fitness and price...and what it looks to stand at that corner would take awhile to unpack!  At the end of the day, isn't that what we're *all* looking for once we cast aside our emotional ascription onto food?
