Late last night, I wiped out my WordPress install for this move, but this morning I had second thoughts.  After doing the worn WP-CLI route and updating the configs, specifically regarding comments, I realized, "This is a bloaty hassle."

There's a few tweaks I need to do.  I went with the Minimal-Mistakes theme just because I already had it customized to my CSS/HTML, though I'd like to find a DataTables solution that works...assuming I don't go ahead and run down what in the theme breaks the functionality.  Right now, I'm just going with a bland non-sortable markdown table.
