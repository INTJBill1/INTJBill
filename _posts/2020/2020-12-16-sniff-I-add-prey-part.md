For all the wonderful weather in the 60's and 70's that framed my last posts, we are now bundled up in the 30's.

As for me, the only bummed feelings I have on the matter is that the bitter chill removes the opportunity to comfortably move in the park or train in my gym.  Not that it is particularly cold; I took my lumps in Alaska! Oh, I *could* train alone in the park or return to my 3-somethings in the morning.  I just might.  

For days now, I've been waking up ready to start my day at...1:20 AM.  I'll lay in bed for a couple of hours before drifting off again.  With a 7:30 PM bedtime, I get plenty of sleep, but I just find the consistency to be curious...and while I have no interest in returning to a 2:30 AM kickoff for workouts, there is an opportunity in there for something.

My Carnivore life has been fantastic!  As previously posted, I'm not weighing in until NYE 2020, but I look slimmer.  In my combined two meals a day, my hunger signaling has reduced my ground beef eating from 2 lbs to 1.5 a day.  I suspect the recent addition of *Carolina Pride's Smoked Bacon Ends and Pieces* at lunch and its bacon fat on my beef plays a part!  I don't eat a mound of bacon—perhaps a <= 5 strip equivalent?

That said, today's 1st meal was a beef roast that spent 10 hours in a crockpot with its broth added.  

This is living!  I'm losing weight, eating as much as I want, and benefiting from foods with fantastic bioavailability of nutrients.

My energy levels have been great which is why I tore down by hand my outdoor deck then queued and shoved all of its boards into the raging fire inside my (now defunct) storm shelter.  It was on my to-do list for a few years.  

While it is unlikely that I'll plunge below the 200 lb threshold on NYE, I'll give a good run at beating my lowest weight in the last 15 years, 2019's 208.  While at the start of The 17th Expedition on December 3rd, I weighed in at 237, I wouldn't be surprised that by weigh-in on January 14th if I dropped 40 lbs as I did in The 1st, 4th, 7th, and 11th Expeditions (those were in restart sessions).  That said, as my keto approach came to a stop in November, this Carnivore Expedition *feels* like a restart.

More importantly, I just *feel* good. My body will reflect that soon enough.  Will I get down to my 163 lb target in 2021?  Why not?  I weighed that at 5'9 back when I was 17 as a h.s. wrestler—I'm still that height, so if my body wants to go back there, let's ride that train!
