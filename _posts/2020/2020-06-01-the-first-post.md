Before posting this (*not so*) inaugural post, I *really* wanted to have my site's design in place. And while I *think* I have something coming together, it's far from anything I'd like to feature, so I've chosen to go boilerplate so that I can put something out into the public. I recognize that my involvement on this site, for whatever reason, spurs real world results...it's far *too* easy to hide and not do anything. And if I keep playing with curly brackets in this paint-by-numbers gimmick, I'll never get off the ground.

I want a complete reset to my fitness regimen. I don't even know what it'll look like, except, well, as of midnight earlier tonight, I've started it. OK, so it began a little earlier, but I want that clean June 1 start.

I've considered bringing in all of the old posts of the past, poems from 1996 and posts from 2002 as some sort of repository, but honestly, it gets me down to think about everything I can no longer recover. And honestly, does that sort of historical record launch me out the gate?

So, it's a fresh start. Sure, I'll incorporate things from the past couple of years that work (and hopefully leave what didn't behind). I don't want to stagnate on that and I'm going to explore more.

And maybe by end of year, I'll return to social media to see if anyone remembers me, though I hope they don't recognize me!
