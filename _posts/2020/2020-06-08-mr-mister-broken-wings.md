Soon, my training regimen will begin. I'm four days into the push into the New Year and haven't given much thought about workouts, as I've waited for the initial weightloss, those first feelings of lighter feet, to kick everything off. Plus, there's value in a graduated approach instead of rushing everything up the first day.

While its development is critical for this year's success, writing about workouts doesn't exactly evoke an effusive passage.

Frankly, I get bored with workouts in of themselves. Who doesn't? They are...repetitive. I've been at a crossroads as to how I want to extend my workout time beyond training. I'm leaning more toward my recent consumption of audiobooks via my local library's app. I can never get enough of nonfictionâ€”crank it up 2.0-3.0X and ride that Reading Rainbow. There was once a time when I'd subscribe for a single audiobook for $15 from Amazon, whereas for May alone, I ate up 27 audiobooks for FREE. That's kind of a big deal.

But, I remain undecided with what direction I'll take it. Ultimately, it's GOTTA be something that encourages the time spent in my gym.
