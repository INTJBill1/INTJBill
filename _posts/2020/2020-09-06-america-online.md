I am returning to Facebook—"Zounds, Bill! While Google plays in the shadows, Facebook might as well run up a Jolly Roger atop its user database! You *know* that the honey badger is its corporate mascot!" Let's just say I've let it go of my tension regarding Big Tech...can I change it for the better or smack developers over the head with a newspaper with a stern, "Bad Devvy, bad?"  

I've been out in the digital desert for far too long.  There are reasons for that, of course, and the superficial ones are always the easiest one to list.  The real reasons...well, the real ones hurt...at least once upon a time.  Do they still or are they exhibits featured on a stroll through the museum of my mind? As it has been sung:

> When you reach the part where the heartaches come,     
> The hero would be me.    
> But, heroes often fail.     
> And you won't read that book again     
> Because the ending's just too hard to take.    
>

Indeed, *all* of that, I have released.  This is a world of imperfect information, isn't it?  I make decisions based on limited information and a limited mind.  How can I fault others who face the same context? 

It's far too easy to allow the construct featured in the Pixar movie, *Inside Out*, to play out, that is, joyful memories turn blue in the context of later events.  Yet, I reject that for memories address specific bubbles of time—precious spheres not connected to our typical timeline of monotony and stands apart from the scaffolding of other memories.    

And while that dated wing of the gallery has some astonishing pieces, visits there are just something to do on a rainy day.  The thriving park outside is ALIVE with delightful dynamic iterations!

As part of that realization, I will return to Facebook—just not yet!  I've got my countdown set to New Year's Eve—quite literally via JavaScript. 

In the meantime, I've got books to hear, weights to lift, and a treadmill to traverse...
