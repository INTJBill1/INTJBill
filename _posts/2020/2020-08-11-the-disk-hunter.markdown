My brief foray into Todoist adoption has ended:  I just didn't have my shoes blown off.  It seems like another screen that demands attention; it's another AI that queries for input.

It wasn't *bad*, it just...made life feel like a pseudcode:

**while X condition is true, do y**

That basically boils down every day of my life.  Throw in an armload of instances of that and BAM: any task management software pines for attention.  

 Maybe I shouldn't put so much of my life into apps?

We are organic creatures!  And I'm led to believe that we aren't even linear entities, much less algorithmic ones.

And still...I recognize that I want to find some place in my schedule to shove in Python and JavaScript classes.  And yet...I don't desire those studies because of an *If C, then $* dynamicâ€”I know, most think it's *All About the Benjamins*, however in my case, it's forever been *All About the Pentiums.*

With my aptitude toward technology, why am I not barn dancing with every "productivity" app out there?  I don't know...maybe on some level, I wonder if we fail to set the parameters of what it means to be productive?  Is my existence project management?  Is it about hitting quotas?  Is it simply outlined by statistical analysis in quantitative research?  Am I defined by my relation to N standard deviations away from the mean?  I suspect it would be easier to catalog if it was, launching the *I am the sum of my parts* scientist into an ebullient ecstasy, not unlike her popping back a handful of strawberry Nerds followed by a cascading Pixy Stix chaser.  

And yet...is that reality?  Or, should I just plug-and-chug my life into a smart phone?
