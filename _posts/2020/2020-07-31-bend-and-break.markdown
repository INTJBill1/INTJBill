While The 13th Expedition was about getting into the rhythm of a keto diet leaving only the 5th and 6th weeks for workouts, The 14th Expedition is all about the implementation of a training regimen to run in tandem with nutrition.

I lookedup [a blog post by Mark Sisson](https://www.marksdailyapple.com/the-primal-essential-movements), author of *Keto for Life: Reset Your Biological Clock in 21 Days and Optimize Your Diet for Longevity* (2019).  I'm *really like* the implementation of the 4 exercises he posts.  And I gotta admit, at 66 he is cranking out a workout that knocks me back. C'mon, **decline Spider-Man pushups** at his age?!  Get out of here!

One of my takeaways from the book for direct application is to pull back on the throttle for my morning routine.  It's a carryover from when I was young, but when I train, I thrive to rail against the temptation to quit.  But, when I step back, can I really say that what I'm doing is fun?  If I'm not enjoying what I'm doing, then its going to take will to get it done.  And from experience, I know that despite having the will to go for 116 days on 1150 kcal /day, I eventually stopped.  A force of will *in whatever application* is just not sustainable.  It's great to work in a pinch, but, it's simply not a starter.

I enjoy having a meditation space; I value having a workout in the morning.  These things are important to me.  But, when I push beyond fun where it feels it breaks me, or at least, breaks me from all the other activities I want to accomplish in a day, then I gotta re-evaluate.
