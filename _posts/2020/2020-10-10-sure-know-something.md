I figure today's blog might hit on a few areas of discretionary spending on my part:

## Google One

I'm now 18 GBs into the 1st tier of service of 100; it's beyond the 15 GB of a free account.  FINALLY, I have a decent backup solution in place.  Not that I didn't like my WD My Cloud solution, but its hard drives are getting a little long in the tooth and their replacement may be infeasible. 

As far as Google as the service provider...well...as it has been best said, "The Matrix has you."

## Training

I'm still waiting for my gloves from [Sanabul](https://sanabulsports.com/) to be fulfilled.  Maybe I could have went with Amazon, but I really prefer to go directly to the vendor and avoid Amazon's hegemony. 

Eventually, I'll have to step up my intensity game because I just don't trust my legs to avoid injuries. When I do get those gloves in, I'll be putting in a *lot* of work on the bag.  I *really* need to put a moratorium on jogging until I'm under the 200 lb threshold to mitigate the risk of injury.  I don't see how I can put in 2+ hours 6 days a week if I don't shut running down for the rest of 2020.

## Coffee & Tea

While a part of me misses [Black Rifle Coffee Company](https://www.blackriflecoffee.com/),  I'm weighing in on returning to tea, a companion through the graduate school, Czech Republic, and Alaska adventure. There's greater variety, approaches, and learning involved with tea than coffee, and there's more bang for the buck—I mean, who grabs used coffee grounds to make another cup?  It's not that I'm punting coffee, I enjoy Pablo's Pride (and its price point) from Sam's Club. Hopefully, I can run down my spreadsheet of past favorites from [Upton Tea Imports](https://www.uptontea.com/).  

Admittedly, like coffee, tea reminds me of those good times of past years—like a cherished song.

## Future Purchases?

I'd like to find a vendor for clothes for 2021 when I drop into my goal weights.  Sometimes I wish I kept all of my old stuff—the clothes I wear really hasn't changed since the 90s.  I'd still rock a KISS concert t-shirt, lemme tell you!  And those Levi's I owned would have lasted forever.  I miss my old black leather jacket from that time—though as that was the latter 90s, it would be too big for the weight I'm dropping down to in 2021. I suppose all of those old t-shirts from wrestling and martial arts tournaments might be beyond their Best By dates...

I'd also be interested in making my own candles as a project in 2021.
