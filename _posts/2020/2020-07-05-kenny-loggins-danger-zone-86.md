A pro tip for writers on Windows: FocusWriter—I dunno, perhaps it has Mac and Linux ports, but for my purposes on Windows 10, it is a delightful, distraction-free writing tool.

I set the theme to a black background with white text, and then use Segoe UI as the font since its the Windows 10 system font, i.e. the font that is best designed for the environment...or so the theory goes—it's why I use it for my body text if you're coming from the same kind of box as mine and something different if you're visiting from a Mac, phone or on a console aboard a UFO hovering above Groom Lake.

And since I'm at the crossroads of almost-42-year-old eyes honored with all the macular degeneration that such an honor is entitled, I cranked up the font to whatever is readable while still possessing the nimble, cat-like dexterity for travel in Xanadu of Lexicon.

I'd wear glasses, but, then I'd miss out out on my ethereal vision of the world. When I drive off to the county dumpster for household trash, Samwise Gamgee rides shotgun in my truck as the Nazgul gnats take chase with our departure.

Sometimes, we do not seek clarity. Take this quotation by Bill Bryson from his *The Body: A Guide for Occupants*:

    Microbes are not the only inhabitants of your skin. Right now, grazing in the divots on your head (and elsewhere on your oily surface, but above all on your head) are tiny mites called <em>Demodex folliculorum</em>. They are generally harmless, thank goodness, as well as invisible. They have lived with us for so long that according to one study their DNA can be used to track the migrations of our ancestors from hundreds of thousands of years ago. At their scale, your skin to them is like a giant crusty bowl of cornflakes. If you close your eyes and use your imagination, you can almost hear the crunching.
