This morning, I shot Vlog #2.  And while I would *love* to regale a tale with this morning's workout, I'll just refer my reader to the video supplement!  Suffice it to say, I'm finding my quads to be spent.

Vlog #2 (UPDATE: Link retired!)

The other day, I resubscribed to a service that I find motivating during my cardio sessions:  UFC's Fight Pass.  There's a strong, positive correlation to my viewership and the overall success of my approach in both duration and intensity.  Audiobooks, footballâ€”even music, fail to compete.  If I had a large TV and broadband access, I suppose basketball might compete, but at this juncture, I might as well speak of taking laps aboard a yacht cruising across the Caribbean!

I am loving this time of year as the temperatures drop and we move toward the Christmas season.  As I wrote a couple of years back:

> Fall is the romance of yesteryear. Fun memories are wrapped up in this time; times of beginnings and opportunities; and the promise of acquiring more knowledge in a discipline.

I took a moment this morning around 5AM to embrace the night sky, breathing the brisk air underneath the canopy of stars.  Unmarred by city lights, the world seems a million miles away from my country porch.

I look forward to reconnecting with people again come New Year's Eve.  I might even return to the news again since it would be unavoidable in a return to Facebook.  That said, my mind is a content place.  I look forward to the day when AI has advanced to give my own news, stories informing me of my own sphere:

* Was there an adroit field mouse that parkoured my soda can / water bucket trap?
* What beasts stayed in the yard overnight?
* A cultural feature on people who lived here 200 years ago.
* Is the groundhog family gone for good?
* What is the status on the fire ant excursion?
* An opinion piece on the best decade of music.

A sports recap would be awesome!
