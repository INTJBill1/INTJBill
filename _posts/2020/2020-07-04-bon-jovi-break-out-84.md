I'm making a shift in The 13th Expedition, my metaphor of a yacht into the sunset is now a speedboat!

I am rockin' it! Into the 17th day, I feel ALIVE! I wouldn't argue that my body is now ready to burn energy.

As of this morning, I am a subscriber to the Black Rifle Coffee Club, which for me, is three bags (12 oz each) of whole bean coffee each month. I specifically chose its *Murdered Out* option, its extra dark roast option for I gotta have my dark brew. BRCC's description:

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    From the deepest, darkest&nbsp;corners&nbsp;of Colombia,&nbsp;we present to you our darkest roast. Murdered Out's smoky, smooth flavor will fuel your midnightops or your morning commute.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Hoorah!

The veteran-owned and employed BRCC also gives its consumer the opportunity that for every bag purchased, they donate one to the U.S. military, leaving it up to the customer to choose which branch. I nearly chose the Marines, until I saw that they now include.... **THE SPACE FORCE**.

I didn't even know we had the Space Force, but it's something new to 2020. I say sign me up and I'll blast those Martian commies right outta space! I gotta send coffee to those service men and women who are brainstorming the genesis of our 22nd century military.
