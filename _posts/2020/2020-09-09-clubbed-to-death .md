I'm in the last day of The 14th Expedition!  OK, I don't expect I'll hit big numbers tomorrow; in fact, I've hit a bit of a wall in the last week or soâ€”it's why I started this week to FINALLY implement a workout program!

There are new features on this site!  While there are some better organized features on this site, I now I have a Software Standards page.  [Read more about it here...](/geek/#software-standards)

It is something I've needed and I'm surprised that it took me this long for it to enter my mind.  I don't know of anyone else who ever applied it to their own life, but it makes sense.

* the *808-Day, Part II Approach;*
* the current Expedition; 
* and my return to Facebook.

I have ideas for more content, but I didn't want to get *too* far ahead on the dev side without updating the live site.
