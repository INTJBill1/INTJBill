There's 150 lbs of ground beef in my freezer squeezing space with 30 days of bacon and I just received notification that an audiobook I've been waiting for a couple of months for is now available from the Brooklyn Public Library, Paul Saladino's *[The Carnivore Code: Unlocking the Secrets to Optimal Health by Returning to Our Ancestral Diet](https://carnivoremd.com/my-book/)*!  While I've read an armload of books on keto, this will be my first one on carnivore and my first audiobook since...October maybe?  There was a time I was knocking out at least one a day, and it's something I'd like to return to if I can run down my book list again. 

Of course, I now enter the second month of a carnivore diet at the precipice of 2021, as I write on Christmas Eve. 

I want to change the current status of this site.  While I absolutely LOVE the ease that it is to post and the inherent speed of a Jekyll & GitHub site, WordPress does provide extended functionality that I miss, things like my currently playing outputâ€”not that functionality is critical, of course, but it does provide a certain...humanity, to the Internet, that I'm more than an AI referencing a contextual corpus.

Plus, as I get my website hosting for free, I never quite *feel* like this is my site entirely.  I know that's just something in my head, though, come to think of it, on a very fundamental level, so is EVERYTHING else, from my vantage point anyway.
