I'm trying out a new feature for my website:  vlogs!  OK, so maybe not a full-blown feature variety—again, I ask a lot out of my LTE connection out in the country:

Vlog #1 (UPDATE: Link retired!)

That said, I thought it would be fun to see the developments in the upcoming weeks and again, something that will further push me to achieving success.

I spent yesterday afternoon moving my powered woodworking tools out of the garage so that I could spread out my gym equipment.  The inhalation of saw dust makes a great showstopper for workouts.

It was an engrossing hobby for a time, but its such a scope creep nightmare:  there's always one more widget to buy—clamps, glues, router bits, stains, sandpaper, chisels—you get the idea!  It would be cheaper just to collect LEGO sets!

While I've got a few things in place in my gym, including a thrift store find stereo receiver with my upgrade of a bluetooth receiver, there remains more work to do to bring it live for this new season of morning workouts.  I'm excited as I feel this is the first time I have momentum to carry me into the Christmas season and beyond.
