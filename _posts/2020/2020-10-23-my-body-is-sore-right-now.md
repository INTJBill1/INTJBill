While I applaud my 4-6:35 AM session this morning, what is it with 42 where I am just piling up the tweaks?  Yesterday, I was sensitive to my left foot and left knee.  Today, its the inner side of my left heel and my right knee.  Oh, and I've got a crazy bruise on my right elbow that is a sensitive to the touch.

Honestly, I look forward to talking to friends again.  I've been off social media for years now and lost touch with...well, pretty much EVERYBODY!  I gotta change that...maybe 2021 will feature a few games at the Liberty Bowl with my beloved Tigers on the field and in the stands.
