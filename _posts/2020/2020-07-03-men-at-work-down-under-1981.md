There was a pull to open a Google account. I knowâ€”I said in the past how I pulled up and climbed out of that whirling vortex. You see, I wanted to add additional functionality to this site, that I can submit a form to update a Google Sheet which is in turn, read by a plugin to update future bar, line, and every other graph under the sun.

Ultimately, I resisted this approach because of my realization that the management of all that nonsense would exceed the time savings of data entry.

And while I've shared my thoughts on Google in the past, nevertheless, I still use Google Charts because it's more of a passive relationship. And honestly, even if I did go beyond my strict diet off 3rd party cookies, Google can get a pretty good idea of our browsing habits by tracking Google font calls (if they do, who knows, but I would in their position). Though I don't apply any Google fonts to my site directly, I'll still have a plugin or an embed that will call up something.

And I do have an Android phone, albeit one not connected to Google Play and applies alternatives instead (Aurora and F-Droid).

On other fronts for 2020, in addition to my offline approach to social media, I'm also going cold turkey on "news" media. It all feels like I'm being shelled by ideological propaganda. Instead of stuffing my face from the media buffet, I want to select strategic foods that are dense with nutrition instead of the HFCS-infused, caramel-covered dung of the masses.

Who knows? By January 2021, maybe I'll be sitting in the mud with everyone else as we make and share our pies together.
