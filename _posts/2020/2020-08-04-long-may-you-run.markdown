I feel good!  Yesterday's workout was FANTASTIC.  After taking Sunday off, I had a full battery of pent-up energy.  I didn't *even* feel the runs in my HIIT. Later, as I oscillated in another set of HIITs between bag work and situps on the exercise ball, I didn't even notice the time to downshift and just kept cranking them out one after another.

I didn't even intend to train at a higher rate that morning as I wanted to slide into a low-intensity approach as I'm adopting 80/20, but, when you've got the green light, you gotta go! Shake 'n' bake!

There may be something to this keto approach after all, the diet that our bodies are designed to eat.  Fun fact: our brains have shrunk since our move to agriculture.  But, hey, without that move, would we have today's globalization?  So, we're all likely dumber for it and have worse teeth, but, there's more of us?  Win?

We'll just file that under *Things I Gotta Fix When I Find My DeLorean Keys*. Tell ya what, that first farmer is gonna FREAK when I chase him around the field at 88 mph!
