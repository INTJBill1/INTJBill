ANOTHER *great* day in the gym. I beat my alarm clock this morning so I made it a 3-something AM workout until after 6. What I'm *hoping* out of these sessions is that along with the increased cardio, that structurally, I'll be stronger to minimize any injury letdowns in 2021. I've heard that vegan diets tend to lead to more injuries and perhaps that's something I've dealt with in the past and something that will *stay* in the past now that I'm CARNIVORE!

(I really ought to rip my shirt off like The Hulk when I say thatâ€”or at least an '80s Hulk Hogan!)

I'm excited about my impending social media return after YEARS away. There are some folks that I really miss! Admittedly, things have been quiet out in the country.

I also look forward to bringing in helpful resources, whether it is the [Zeroing in on Health FB group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/zioh2/) or motivating Instagram users. I might even find some accountability on FitBit. I know that 2020 was the year that I found the medias to be just a caustic space so I avoided them for most of the year, so I don't really know if I'd reintroduce Twitter. At some point, our resources get spread to thin to apply to our own projects. Can't always sit in the stands!
