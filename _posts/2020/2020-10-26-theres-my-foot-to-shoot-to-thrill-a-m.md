I'm proud of the workout I put in today, but oh, NOT for the effort on my part.  It was largely flat and the worst one since this revitalization.  I reached a place in my striking routine where both emotionally and physically, I struggled hard to keep extending.  I began feeling it in the third set of my 3:00/1:00 minute approach and pushed until the 7th set where I didn't want to throw one more punch.  I was tempted to hang up my gloves for the day.  I paused my interval timer, popped back some sunflower seeds, and charged back into the fight to finish all 15 sets.

I'm so GLAD I dug down and made it.  The funny thing is that I thought it would be a good workoutâ€”I was out there before 4AM coming off yesterday's rest day.  The tweaks never buffed out, but I had high spirits.  Then boom.

As much as I drive events with my will, whether weight loss or allocated energy, my body determines the environment.  I would have preferred a snappity-snap-snap Monday morning session, but I'll pull through these as well as I drive to my goal.

Did my diet influence this?  Yesterday, I made a shift with a return to broccoli & spinach; flax & sunflower seeds; and coffee & fats. And cacao powder!  There is too much change to pin it on one target, and I'm doubling back to my carnivore focus, though I'm unsure as to how that would look like.

You know what they don't tell you about flax seed?  Sure, we've grown it for a long, long time...to WEAR!  While we think that people eating cotton on a diet is crazy, how is it any different that those who put linen into their smoothies?!  Seriously, I've eaten a LOT of  linen since 2018.  Yep, flax: the same stuff they wrapped up mummies.
