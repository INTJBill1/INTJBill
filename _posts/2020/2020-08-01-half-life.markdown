Hello August and we're "cruisin' down the freeway in the hot, hot sun...Is that a Chevy '69? How bizarre."

I love August.  It's the gateway through the threshold of promise.  How many Septembers did I have such hopes for the semester that lay ahead!

Of course, August *absolutely* sucks.  The sun is too hot; the air is far too thick with water.  Fall is ever so tantalizing close, yet, here is this weird place on the calendar where any outdoor activity grinds to the pace of a beached whale.

Who am I kidding?  It's gonna feel like summer 'till October.  I generally just choose to stop cutting the grass in October because...well, it's UNNATURAL.

Oh, the dream of autumn..."Set adrift on memory bliss of you, baby, you send me! " That brisk rustle through the night leaves...I'm full of wonderâ€”even today.

It's funny how the mind spins and circles down the analog calendar and can I see, hear, smell, touch, and taste again...

>You know, I know this steak doesn't exist. I know that when I put it in my mouth, the Matrix is telling my brain that it is juicy and delicious. After (twenty-four) years, you know what I realize?
