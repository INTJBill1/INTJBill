When I look back at those summers of ago, that time of '96 into '97, Queen's *[It's a Kind of Magic](https://open.spotify.com/album/34xBXeJgmQrn1wQvhyVCsw?si=JenKuW7HTo6iF4R6eWQReQ)* comes to mind, an album that served like a soundtrack to Highlander and by extension, the TV series by the same name starring Adrian Paul (a show I absolutely loved).  I say "served like a soundtrack," because the album itself can stand on its own without a movie.  I also played the first 4 selections from [the actual CD that feature the franchise's scores](https://open.spotify.com/album/5RE6tjCm7hBOlpekCUSIwX?si=E8Fxjz1sTtqYIAAvkf-TkQ), though its sequels were rubbish (and the 4th song sounds like this from *Band of Brothers* which makes sense as they are both from Kamen). 

I look fondly back at that old Queen CD, because I never returned to it as I grew older, so as I listen to it now, it reminds me of all those drives with the top down, feeling invincible with a wide open horizon to explore and love life.  I TOTALLY bought into the paradigm of being among the *Princes of the Universe*, from those iconic lyrics that might describe how I viewed my existence at 18-19.  I've already written how my first presence on the Internet autoplayed a piano MIDI of *Who Wants to Live Forever*.  Playing that old song reminds me of who I once was...perhaps at my core, still am...  

...and these 44-year-old eyes now look back at those 18 and 19-year-old days and consider how the rain fell on that sunny ride. Looking back at 18 and 19 when you've got 44-year-old eyes that see how things the machinations churned out..I guess I'm reminded of Wahlberg's [*Invincible*, a movie with a great soundtrack in its own right](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/10qKeTuho7uUMTn8f5GdZz?si=a8339364adfc42c5). It would be naive for me to believe I'd keep the top down forever on my convertible.

I have no interest in fading away.  I know at 44, this might seem to be a silly thing to say—gosh, when I see "44" I find in of itself to be UNREAL.  I'm still me!   I just employ a collective use of EM dashes, ellipses and semicolons now!  

No, I have no interest in fading away.  If I'm not cranking out the reps when I'm 60 to 80 years old, it doesn't mean my will has been snapped; it means a hot balloon wicker basket has come crashing down to Earth on my noggin'.
