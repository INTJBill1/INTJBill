I made it through the dreaded Day 3.  Whether fasting or adopting a ketogenic application as I leave a high sugar diet behind, how I have LOVED splashing into the inviting waters of the 4th day!  In those first three days, I am dangerously sensitive to emotional eating.  Even as I recognize my lack of appetite, I'll plow through a shelf of crinkly-packaged pastry narcotics!  And this is from a guy who can absolutely CRUSH a bag of roasted pistachio nuts to the point that it makes me belch a stench from the black cauldron pot of Hell. "Nothing a few more handfuls can't fix!"

When eating is no longer rational, it no longer matters I recognize how the oligarchy that is carbs is just another name for sugar.  When I eat for the moment as I shove things into the magical box that is my mouth, I don't consider how that product influences my system, or greater still, my vision for the future.  No, I funnel my sugary delights down my throat like a toddler flushing down her stuffed animal.  \*poof\* Tada!  And while I gotta think there has been at least one time I came away from a night of gorging to review it with a thumbs up for brilliancy, I've largely experienced intense regret before shaking my fist a couple of times and seeking a night of tumbling slumber to ease the discomfort.

The thing is, food fails to answer our negative reaction to emotions.  These emotions are ephemeral, hence why they can so easily be driven away by our sugar stimulants!   Unfortunately, those same sugars can pile on pounds onto our problems.  We don't have a plan in our backpocket to whip out that will shoo those emotions away AND put us in a superior position down the road.  

And THIS is why I like Day 4: I slip out of Sugar's *omoplata domo arigato misuta robotto* choke hold.
