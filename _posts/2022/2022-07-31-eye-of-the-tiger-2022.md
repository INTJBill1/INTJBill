After an initial confusion as to how weigh-ins work (that silly idea of not consuming anything *before* weigh-in), I kicked off the 27th Expedition this past Saturday.   Yes, it has been far too long.

I officially came in at 248 lbs.  And while this website will *eventually* be molded to support this renewal of mine, for now, just know that my weight is near to when I first submitted to a carnivore life (for good) back in November 2020.  And as I read those old entries around that time frame, I had forgotten how amused I was that I lost so much weight while eating around 3000 kcal a day.  I had proven that calories have nothing to do weight gain/loss.  But, how that idea is hammered in my head!  How then, did I ever skyrocket from that 182 lb weight up to my present weight?  I didn't eat ENOUGH.  You got it!  When my body wanted more meat, what did I do?  I drank that ol' HWC after my 1st carniversary.

Again and again and again. 

A part of me thought I ought to minimize things, eat just a lb of meat a day—ignore hunger feelings and satiety.  Follow a schedule, save money and reduce calories...

...and that is how I EXACTLY gained weight!!!  **A carnivore approach to life  is NOT about restriction!**  We eat our fill.  We listen to our bodies.  

I HATE that I forgot that.  My return to Memphis likely messed up my head regarding this for when I was out in the country, I was far more of a focused individual, my 3x speed audiobooks were never fast enough, my drive to train was unquenchable.  For reasons foreign to me, I must recapture that *Eye of the Tiger.*

What am I eating?  Bacon.  OK, more to the point: bacon fat, meats, butter, eggs, coffee and water—I even have spam on deck for the occasional weekly treat! Sure, bacon is great, but bacon fat just makes everything better.  A lb of calf liver in the bottom of your meat drawer (air fryer) with a couple dollops of bacon fat is a delightful meal; liver begs for fat!  I ate that around 2 PM until eating a 3-egg omelet around 9 PM this evening.  

Stay tuned. Things are changing.  The next weigh-in?  September 10.
