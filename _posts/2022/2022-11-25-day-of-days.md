This is the first post on my brand new MacBook Pro 16" Laptop - Apple M1 Pro chip. A Black Friday find with $500 off, this laptop is superior to my Acer Nitro5, my sometimes Windows 10, sometimes Linux Mint workhorse that's complete with duct tape and struggles with a nasty habit of locking up when being moved. To be fair, I don't do too well when somebody picks me up either.

To commemorate the event and to further support a fundamental shift in 2023, I have boxed my Jekyll installation in lieu of this Wordpress install. And thus, not only is this my first post on my new Mac, but also the first one for this new setup. I do LOVE Jekyll and its text files, but 2023 will be far less technical with a greater emphasis on creativity. Yes, there will be a lot less SSH in my life. Can I imagine a year without installing a Linux distribution?

Even running my own Mac is a throwback for me. There was once a time in 2004 when I toted a silver MacBook Pro around the country, transcribing my European adventures, applying for jobs in Flagstaff while drinking coffee at [Bookman's](https://bookmans.com/). Later in 2005, I'd pick up a 20" iMac, which was [a beautiful machine in its day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac_G5). Still later, there was a run-of-the-mill, white iBook to lug around a 2007 Europe. And as the years rolled on, I moved on to other hardware. When I think of a Mac, I'm reminded of my 2001 time at the Ugly Mug when my very good friend then, Nic, used to proselytize ALL-THE-TIME about its features. I mean, if you're gonna jump on board with its ideology, what a great time it was with the release of the iPod in October 2001. And the rest, of course, is tech history.

As I continue to gear up for 2023, I've got [a strap replacement by Kiwi](https://www.amazon.com/KIWI-design-Accessories-Enhanced-Support/dp/B098JTDPQC) coming in for my Quest 2.  With Facebook's use of velcro to secure the set to my head, it makes me think they were all out of duct tape over in Menlo Park when they threw the thing in the box. I thought I could just wrastle with it as is, but I do look forward to greater support. And hey, I just started applying a drop of Dawn dish soap to the lens to mitigate my heat during a workout!

I've also thrown a couple more apps into the VR workout mix:

* **Les Mills Body Combat** - I REALLY like this app and its greater focus on form. While I do enjoy Supernatural, I like LMCB's one-time purchase of $20 with its specialization on striking.  I appreciate [this guy's review in comparing the two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l__0Tzq1zr4). He's spot-on with his assessment as LMBC feels like coaches where Supernatural comes off too...cult-of-personality/relational. I mean, yes, if there was a REAL person there, sure, tell me about your life 20 years ago and how that song impacted you. But there's gotta be a realization that you are just a stand-in for AI.

* **[Ragnarock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qC5LeAVzDlM)**  - Yeah, the same reviewer referenced this app and after watching its video, I HAD to go with it!  I don't know if its the blood within me from my 19th century Viking forbearer or just my like for [Wardruna](https://open.spotify.com/track/0hjczqsEDgNhPTd8JLUlbq?si=c9126c3efa3942df), but its a lot of fun to crash along to the music!

I've got a new store in Memphis that I LOVE: [Gordon Food Service Store](https://gfsstore.com/) over on Union in the old OfficeMax ([YouTube of specific loc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCp3zEuDM6w)). I picked up 20lbs of ground beef for $2/lb.
