I dedicated a total of 105 minutes of Thursday in both afternoon and evening workouts on the the Supernatural app with trainer, Leanne Pedante.  It continued my workout streak on the platform past the 4th day.  The most curious song I trained to today was *Soul Bossa Nova* by Quincy Jones.  You know it:

...yeah, that one was fun to move to!

I also relaxed for a spell in Beat Saber and was able to get through Blinding Lights on normal mode for my first time.  Here's an example from a random player:

It was just this August when I'd limp around the house with crutch in hand with that knee injury.  I could not lift my foot beyond an inch off the floor! While I've made significant progress, I'm not completely out of the woods with it yet as there's something iffy going on with it as there remains a little fluid build up.  Nevertheless, I feel confident that between my carnivore and training approaches, I'll *simma down now* it.  I'm aided that Supernatural is a low-impact program that runs my heart through its paces without me even knowing it.  I even have to check my Garmin to keep from redlining the ol' engine.
