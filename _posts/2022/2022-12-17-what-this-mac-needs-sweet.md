Wow, that IS some mighty fine Kool-Aid!

Do you remember what I wrote SO LONG about Mac n' Stuff?  It seemed like it was yesterday...well, I've taken a portal to Bizarro World, so just flip it.  Consequently, I spent my day in very familiar territory, albeit time-consuming.  Same words...just parenthetical updates:

1.  Restore (Apple exclusivity); Migrate content back to (Apple) drive and turn off (Google) Drive.
2. (Leave) Bitwarden; Consider using (Apple) logins for everything; Delete passwords from (Bitwarden)
3. (Elevate Safari and consider Brave)
4. ((Hey, there’s no status of change with Tutanota!!))
5. Optimize and (increase) complexity: (Return) to the text editor and terminal life. Establish (Jekyll static).
6. (Migrate remaining Google content and delete Google account).

Well, why the flip?  I made some valid points—what gives?  It began when my Google Drive refused to sync correctly to my MacBook.  The client said it synchronized to the cloud, but I KNEW it was missing files–and so it was!  I had some zipped-up site backups that weren't downloaded to my computer.  I wouldn't have even noticed if I wasn't specifically looking for those archives to add content to my site. 

And once I realized I couldn't trust the syncing process, it trembled with the memory of 2014.   Well, one thing led to another and I tossed it out.  

Wordpress got caught in the crossfire!  OK, not exactly: I already grew weary of updating two places for anything I post, the blog, of course, and the document file.  And lemme tell ya, having one Google Doc/LibreOffice file of everything is unwieldy!  Bit by bit (quite literally), I'm taking the complexity from my life.

And, I don't know, I got nostalgic.  I read a few of my posts when I was getting Jekyll to run back in 2020 and just missed it.

OK, so what about the showstoppers?  Didn't they stop the train for a reason?

**Abhorrent ad blockers for Safari** - Yes, this remains AWFUL.  But, I'll sure I'll find a solution that allows me to use Safari instead of Brave.

**Interoperability issues** - Without Google, my phone's ability is reduced anyway, so my not having a proper iCloud client is par for the course.

**The mail server** - Day and night!  Perhaps the mail server just didn't trust my account being taken out of mothballs, 'cause now I've run it through its paces, the performance hits my expectations.

Ultimately, the big winner is flipping on end-to-end encryption on iCloud.  In the past, I've researched other cloud providers for that ability because the mainstream didn't offer it.  Frankly, it seems like an obvious, Day 1 feature.
