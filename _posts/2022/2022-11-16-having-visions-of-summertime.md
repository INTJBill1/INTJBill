I'm nowhere near the stamina I once possessed in my gym (and I miss slamming my Everlast gloves into the bag), but I'm having a lot of fun!  And I need to dial back things 'cause I'm hitting max heart rate and lovin' it!  That's a key to repeatable fitness: fun.  There's NO WAY I'd be doing all of this sustainable movement in the house if it wasn't for this headset.   It's a surreal fealing to exist in virtual reality as if I have a portal to an alternate universe.

Admittedly, I'm a bit enamored with the app.  It ties into my vision that I see in the future:  *Summer '23*.
