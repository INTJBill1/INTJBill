Leading up to today's Thanksgiving holiday, I plopped down my $19/month fee for Supernatural, as I dedicated this upcoming 30 days toward getting fit as I accelerate toward 2023's pace.  Throughout yesterday, I invested two hours of my time into it as I suspect it'll do good for this ol' right leg of mine.  This wheel's performance has dipped a bit in the second half of the year as it was down for repairs while brooding from a mix of entropy & atrophy and its role as a critical piece of the pack mule puzzle.

At morning's light, let's hit the Oregon Trail.

I would welcome a Facebook return if I have any friends to share a leaderboard in Supernatural or Beat Saber.  It's not so much to beat them, rather, it's that feeling of camaraderie that there are *real* people who are out there.  The virtual world is a desolate place.   I am reminded of ST:TNG's [Hotel Royale](https://youtu.be/j24sqLwndlk?t=116).  Ahh, yes, the "alien contaminator."

I nearly wound back on there as I was willing to have a FB account to use the Quest 2 VR set, but recently they removed the requirement.  And maybe (for me) that's the unsettling thing about Facebook's VR platform is how geared it is to...well, unremarkably, socialization. 

Sadly, I don't think we will ever understand the lyrics to *The Sound of Silence*.  Is there room for humanity in the context of monetization?  What problems arise with news sites intersperse real stories with third-party clickbait off to the shadows of an alley?

Furthermore, at what point do we market our lives like clickbait?  And yes, my ideal for Facebook, a place to encourage and build each other up, is...unrealistically optimistic, perhaps even tenaciously untenable?  Is it only a series of [SNL Penelope skits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4maUKzCRCk)? We do know everyone posts from a place of utility maximization; as such, their posts drive toward what their hearts hope to attain the greatest satisfaction. But, is their focus the script or the production? Indeed, "the (post's) the thing wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king."
