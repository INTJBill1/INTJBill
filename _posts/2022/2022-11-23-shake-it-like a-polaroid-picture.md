It was two years today that I moved from a June's keto to a carnivore diet that extended 637 days.  The first bulletpoint from Web MD as to scury's cause lists: "Don't include fruits and vegetables in your diet for many months."  *Yawn.*  The Establishment.  Sad.  

They say that symptoms arise after 90 days.  I HAD THEM (!):

* **Lethargy** - I left all of my energy out on the floor with those 3:30 - 6AM workouts.  Or my 3:30 -5:30 AM workout followed by a drive up to the gym for another hour.

* **Body aches** - You are not kidding!  I'd wreck my body again and again.  The biggest problem was my knuckles for hitting the bag too hard.  I'd switch to forearm/elbow strikes for the next workout and jack them up as well.  I ran out of striking surfaces!  (I guess there was always my head.)

* **Swelling** - Yeah, these delts, bruh.

* **Bruising** - I'd walk around a Tigers' gameday and no doubt bruised a lot of beer-bellied, 40-something-year-old guys' egos when their wives would check me outâ€”OK, so to my knowledge this happened only once, but lemme embellish it!

* **Oral problems**  - I never could keep my mouth shut how awesome carnivore is.

* **Old wounds open** - Every workout I'd find something from deep within to pour into my training.  That's basically the whole new wave genre, right?

Further risks: I even blew up a concrete, storm shelter bunker with these two hands! These superhuman notions nearly wrenched my arm out of socket as I was dragging that deck's 4x4 encased in concrete that hit another one that I dug up.

Quick, somebody toss an orange juice before I attempt to stop trucks from moving with my bare hands (again)!  "Lend me some sugar, I am your neighbor."

## Coffee

It is not completely accurate that I had ABSOLUTELY NO plants in those 637 days: I drank coffee.  On my current carnivore streak, I heavily considered giving up this drug, but I'm going to let it run shotgun beside me again.  To be fair, I lost 149 lbs with coffee in my corner from WAY back, even in that low calorie nonsense that was the ups and downs of the 1-12 Expeditions.  For those of you playing at home, that's a 22 BMI drop (48.9 to 26.9).  Coffee has earned its place.  And talk about steeped with memories...I can't say that for sugar juice.

## The 28th Expedition Moustache

Today marks my third day on my reinvigorated fitness adventure.  Sound familiar?  Like, oh, I dunno...EXACTLY a week ago?!  I pulled down this website and flipped on the switch to the food conveyor. Nom nom nom nom nom nom.  Yes, the proverbial *[Twinkies of Shame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Xxy_DD-a0)* (everything is Twinkies).  Oh, that emotional vixen of Little Debbie! She seduced me on that August night as I was in such wretched pain!  It has taken everything in me to leave her flabby, McLovin' arms!  Ah, but what she, Marie Callender and all the others offer is but a TV-laden loveseat. "They've never seen the Northern Lights. They've never seen a hawk on the wing."  I wish I "never hung (my) hat up at (Nutty Buddy's) place.  I should've been a cowboy."

So, along with my coffee, I'm taking this website on this journey into the horizon. For whatever reason, it's my weightloss talisman.

And if I may continue the western theme further still...I had a fun idea in my head that I'm rolling with as of today: I was growing a beard since August and though how fun it might be to close out the year with just a moustache so that I can shave it off on New Year's Eve.  I'll then  kick off 2023 and The 29th Expedition with another attempt at that untouched growth for a year beard.  For me, facial hair reminds me of my progress, how far I've traveled...
