After a streak of 23 days in my VR fitness regimen, I snapped it yesterday. While my August knee injury stiffened up in the past few days, I thought I could fight through it. Alas, I now recognize that I was just aggravating things. There's a reason why the body stiffens up a joint. Darn all of these VR squats!

I don't think it'll be a setback, but just a streak for me to surpass in the future.

Speaking of which...

I've now finished my FIRST week of being a HIGH-FAT carnivore! It'll be awhile for me to hit my 5-month mark (5/8/23) like Kelly Hogan describes in this video from yesterday, [*High Fat Five-Month Update from a 13-Year Carnivore*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKgUPGUlxJU), where she takes us along for her entire weightloss journey. And who knew her cholesterol numbers would drop even further with a higher fat approach? It's great to hear her talk because she says everything I'd say, but has the chops to back it up. If I could have went back to 2004 and do what she did...I would have punted that vegan nonsense.

Care for a spin in my old rusty Rant Rambler?

Wow, did the yes-men doctors lie to us in the '90s! I remember following their advice and cutting down fat WAY DOWN LOW. I introduced white rice to my diet and ran the Foreman grill for my chicken. Did I get the gains I expected in context to a *Body-For-Life* fitness regimen? "Shaka, when the walls fell..."

Maybe "lie" is too harsh, perhaps those '90s doctors were just Idiots in Authority, like the puppets are today:

"Yeah, masks stop the spread of zombies. I mean, yes, cloth doesn't stop farts, but TRUST us, we stayed in school 'cause we don’t wanna grow up, we're Toys R’ Us kids, we want $millions$ that we can play with, from bikes to trains to political gains...'We're what you call *experts*.'"

What's up, Doc? So, you're gonna lob leaches onto my skin, then shock my brain into submission and finally inject poison into my veins? Naw, I'm good, I'll just let my body do its thing and get out 'ta way. ["You'll never get nowhere smokin' the pipe."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI0gt7vxNCQ)

Now, if it was our man Bashir, that genetically-enhanced doctor running his medical tricorder across the Promenade from Quark's, yeah, run that dermal regenerator! Or, just a guy that can do a decent *Connect the Dots, La, La La*—I'm not asking for Curie stuff here! They can put down the Hulk juice. But, today? It's all power and politics—not truth. When I visualize what happens at those medical conferences, all I see is bespeckled, pudgy men in Hawaiian shirts and pale skinny legs, waddling to Nelly's *[Ride Wit Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxG-M7pbGGk)*. OK, so not far off from any Weird Al concert.

That said, I'm speaking more to the medicine side of things and not so much surgical. I mean, sometimes when we're Bifur, we need more than a headbutt with an Orc. So, less John Dorian and much more of [Turk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-bIhCBSrzU) (well, maybe not the Todd).

Honestly, what we need is NOT medicine...

> What this world needs is a few more rednecks,  
Some people ain't afraid to take a stand.  
What this world needs is a little more respect  
For the Lord and the law and the workin' man.  
We could use a little peace and satisfaction,  
Some good people up front to take the lead,  
A little less talk and a little more action  
And a few more rednecks is what we need.
