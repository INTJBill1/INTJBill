Indeed, it was a time ago, seemingly of another age when this traveler considers his adventure, when on December 16, 2021, I wrote of my disdain of a 5-lb weight gain.  It seemed incongruous to the life I had known (and most assuredly, it was UNDERSERVED).  Never did I seek my teeth into the demonic enticements of Taco Bell; never did I slide down the ride of a sugary temptress! 

Ah, but I pointed to the accused!  Vaguely, I had a sense of the cuprit, that celebratory vice on my carniversary.  Heavy whipping cream cream (HWC).  Such a simple delight and readily carnivore.  In all of these months since, all six of them, I have nearly proven beyond a doubt that I was correct for I have become a regular consumer of this de-evolving device! In these 200+ days hence, I have gained 60 lbs.  And while this gain did not mimic my past rocket rides up the scale, nevertheless, it has made me shudder as I never have broken ranks from my carnivore diet. 

Verily, this must change!  That HWC is the succor of Satan!  

Damn that delight!  

It's ridiculous the number of times I've knocked back a quart of the stuff!  Sometimes it was TWO!  Naturally, it's labeling leads one to think that there's not a single carb in it, but C'MONâ€”try around 27 instead!  Straight-up sugary lactose!  I just gotta think I took a wrong turn somewhere.

The proof is in the puddin', right? What shall I do... 

...exactly how I had so much sustainable success: eat the meat.  Eat when I'm hungry and do no eat when I'm not hungry.  Shelf the salt for a time so as to better gauge when I'm satiated. 

Clearly, this once moth-balled site now shines vibrantly. running.  It's totally functions as a place for accountability for me.
