That ol' UofM train howls across the Saturday nightscape.  These nights call back to earlier times, time when I'd hang out with my sister and her husband for a night of Mexican food and all-night Playstation...or sow a handful of wild oats with Piggly Wiggly buddies...or make another smile in an amber haze.  All of these have slipped through my fingers as only time's sand can.  Some are gone; some are gone forever. 

Tonight is set for the Simon and Garfunkel 1997 compilation, *Old Friends*.  This 3-CD set evokes such ardent feelings out of me.  It once accompanied me in 3 AM drives with an *Everlong* interstate.  Forever will I remember, "And the moon rose over an open field."

I've lost many friends.  I know, I know, this isn't the place to open the heart!  I talk about geeky things—I've even geeked out on talking about carnivore.  Isn't this the place that is a diary in name only?  It's not 20 years ago!  *We must protect ourselves for people will exploit us.* 

I've lost a friend.  I don't know if I lost her forever or she chose to walk away.  The last time I heard from her, she sent me a picture of her picking mushrooms leading up to her 31st birthday in September.  And that was the last time.  I met her in 2010, a Czech who not only shared my INTJ personality, but also who had a mutual interest in music.  

Whenever people would come into and then leave my life, or whatever new scene would develop and then fade out, there she was, a friend unchanged, a warm smile in the background.  She was such a curiosity—she had a tiny frame with a Nina Simone voice.  She had a love for linguistics, baking and simple things, like a walk in a forest.  And inexplicably, she's now gone.  No reason to go.  Just gone.

How often have I disappeared into the night, closed doors or broke hearts! How I hope...it's just that.

And what a time it was, it was   
A time of innocence   
A time of confidences

I have a photograph  
Preserve your memories   
They're all that's left you
