I have waded through the dumpster for far too long.  I have rummaged *Garbage Compactor 3263827* and only came away with a dianoga at my throat.  Should I have expected more?  Indeed, I have witnessed far too much vitriol on comment threads.  It shapes a man's soul.  I'll read the "you owe me" mantra and can hear the rattling of each keystroke.  And the venom has spread to the (angry teenager) journal-ists as the articles become little more than the clickbait of the masses.   It is easy to feed the fire in a culture that no longer believes in truth as "everyone did what was right in his own eyes."  I am Picard in this classic scene of [four lights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjKQQpPVifY).  And while I once reveled in the hijinx of the [BabylonBee](https://babylonbee.com/), when sarcasm hits a mark far too close to reality, laughter in resentful robs joy and calluses the heart.  

Not until "the Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I" wield supreme executive power should I invest much emotional stock in the ways of governance.  And yes, given my Emperor Palpatine mantle, I would cut so many programs it would make [Ron Swanson dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y6qrCgA8M0)!  I mean, my entire basis is found inside *[Don't Buy Stuff You Cannot Afford](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3ZJKN_5M44)*.

And since I don't have that kind power, why emotionally respond in a way to mimic that I do?  Does a blustering rabble of words raise reality or rob tranquility?

Everything I've written today was inspired by this simple YouTube clip, *[4K Cozy Coffee Shop with Smooth Piano Jazz Music for Relaxing, Studying and Working]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYPVQccHhAQ)*.  While I intended it to transport me to another place for writing, its comments section is from an Internet that never was.
