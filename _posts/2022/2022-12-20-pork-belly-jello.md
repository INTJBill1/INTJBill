As I continue to shape my plans for 2023, I recognize the need for task management software.  My Mac's Stickies app was overwhelmed and Google Tasks was just not cutting it (subtasks were broken for the default list, but working for others).  Thus, I opted for Todoist.  I totally stripped it down:  nothing on the sidebar with the exception of projects and index; I took out that karma nonsense and scoring system; I even disabled its smart date functionality as that's always just bedeviled me. 

In the past, I'd flip between the task managers with a bent toward gamification.  But today, I just have no interest in that;  I want to get the job done. 

Speaking of getting the job done, all THREE of the fitness games I wanted went on sale yesterday, so I snapped them up:

* **Synthrider** *($12.49, 50% off)* - I've been considering this for the last couple of weeks as a potential Supernatural replacement.

* **Until You Fall** *($12.49, 50% off)* - With a fantasy element, it *seems* like something I might like.

* **Pistol Whip** *($20.99, 30% off)* - I got my hands on this demo before—who knew I'd start shaking my hips and dancing WHILE shooting people?  What, am I gonna ask next, "How 'bout a magic trick?"

Not remotely related, but I've discovered I developed a taste for the gelatin byproduct from my sous-vide pork belly cooling process.  

Mmm, meaty Jell-O!  

And I've learned of a most excellent way to do an inch-thick ribeye with with an air fryer from Kelly Hogan.  Set it to 15 minutes at 400 and when it gets to 10 minutes, put the steak in.  It'll get it to medium rare.  SO MUCH faster than a sous-vide, reverse sear approach. [Check Kelly's out.](https://youtube.com/shorts/Qz4xzPi9Og0?feature=share)

OK, lastly, I'm TOTALLY pumped:  a couple of nights ago, it hit me out of the blue that I had no need to ever SSH into my webhost to rebuild my static site.  See, my host alllows me to run a cron job by the hour.  All I have to do is to get my script working correctly—I had to account for lack of a .bashrc file for the cron job ([configuring the shell is part of my writeup here](/diary/2021-10-10-installing-jekyll-on-nearlyfreespeech/)).  I've got one job running at midnight (for future dated posts) and another at noon!  And thus, I can just upload a file!  It's a simple thing that Wordpress can post automatically at a future time, but it's fun to think that I'm doing it with a static result.
