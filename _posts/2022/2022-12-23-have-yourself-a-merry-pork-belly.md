I am SO EXCITED: 2023 is almost here!  OK, so I know that all of the pizzazz is supposed to go to Christmas and there is an air of nostalgia from the '80s.  But, we totally took the air out of the inflatable Santa by celebrating *Presents Day* the day after Thanksgiving in a subdued, less event-driven approach.  Instead of an endless array of things that they salivate over for weeks, I just said, "Here's some cool stuff and it's yours."  

It's the way to usher in the season while guiding the kids down the road to adulthood by other means than being stuff-centric. In the past, it was about opening a lot of presents and ensuring they all had the same amount.  Sure, we shot for things they might like, but I think it was of secondary importance.  In those days, we envisioned something like a mound of presents, the type of things you'd sit upon the lap and ask about to that guy at the mall.  It contrasts with the new goal to have less sizzle and more steak.

And this is the first Christmas that I can remember where we stayed on budget.  

As this is the threshold of 2023, I eagerly await what lies beyond.  Moving to a new place: where?  When?  What opportunities will there be?  We toured around Harrisburg, Arkansasâ€”it was completely a shot in the dark.  We even walked about in the Jonesboro Walmart Neighborhood Market; in that hallowed den of the common man, long has it been that eyes have possessed the light of life.

I search on, my eyes see what has not been shown.
