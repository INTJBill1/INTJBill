I scoffed as I lay the disheveled mailings across the kitchen table.  "A flu shot is your best protection against the flu."  Immediately, I mused to myself that a better approach would be to apply an anti-inflammatory diet.  "With nothing else better to do, the body would make quick work of that!"  But, I caught myself:  "Just leap into a missile silo and stay there...done.  That's the best protection!"  Oh, who are we kidding: "Just get it and get it over with.  That's the best protection."

Those ads in the mail never have my interest at heart.  Even "free" shots cost somebody something.  They don't have that in the mailer out of the goodness of their hearts.  They care nothing for what's in my soul, but everything that's in my wallet.

And sadly, the medical field is driven by ideology, not truth.  Can we expect more from a system that promotes shifting sands politics and a "science" that tells me that flies DO spontaneously generate, not from meat, but ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.  Yes, they tell me I've evolved from *nothing*.  The complex came from the simple—wait, wait—from NOTHING.  So, that's the story you're going with?  And no wonder why folks are all messed up in the head with who they are.

I've been at peace with the culture and all the crazy things out there—oh, sure this active rebellion against God is evil—but, I recognize that we are in something like a pre-Christian era, like in the time of Rome or Molech.  And you can imagine my surprise when I heard John MacArthur say the same thing to John Piper in that video I posted the other day!  So, when I hear parents offering up their kids at the altar of the *bizarre*, it makes sense because that's what I would expect from those who hate God.

I'm reminded of the words of Jesus:

> If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you. If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.
>
>  John 15:18-19, ESV

I got caught up with a "That's not right" mindset about our culture.  And no, it's not right because it does not represent the values of God.  But, their end is coming.  Jesus in Mark 9:48 references this Old Testament passage:

> And they shall go out and look on the dead bodies of the men who have rebelled against me. For their worm shall not die, their fire shall not be quenched, and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh.
>
> Isaiah 66:24

And so the world celebrates Jesus' birthday in a handful days.  They celebrate a baby...a baby sent to overcome their own father.  Jesus says this:

> ...I came from God and I am here. I came not of my own accord, but he sent me. Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you cannot bear to hear my word. You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father’s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies. But because I tell the truth, you do not believe me. Which one of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me? Whoever is of God hears the words of God. The reason why you do not hear them is that you are not of God.

It is curious that the world wraps up gifts for a holiday for someone for whom they refuse to love and would rather spend an eternity in Hell than be with Him.
