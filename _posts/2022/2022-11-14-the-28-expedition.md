> Sadly, we're all just a bunch of virtualized people, a series of Photoshopped avatars with our domain controllers instructing us about our network and our place on it. I long to move away from a life planned with and by a computer to one with a couple sheets of graph paper with a pencil in hand.

While I affirm this to be what our culture has latched onto (and I suspect I sit in an exclusive audience of stern eyebrows for the Internet), for all the speed of and discovery therein regarding idiocy that is occurring today, at the end of the day, the Internet is a tool chest.  Accordingly, it should be applied to our lives like a collection of tools.  Unfortunately, there are a bunch of idiots in the shop, whomping a ratchet over their heads!  To each their own, but never force me to applaud the action of that community of ratchet head whompers (as if this community *could* be a thing).

I say all of that to justify my use of powered tools (computers) in conjunction with my hand tools (e.g. pencil and graph paper) to support my ongoing projects including a "new" one:

Today, I (finally) kick off successfully The 28th Expedition.  The six-week weigh-in is on December 26th. It will feature my carnivore return, a revitalized fitness regimen, a clean-up and rebuild of this Jekyll site and a future home for my Facebook return. 

I haven't been a carnivore since August 22, 2022, when a winching knee pain kept me up the night prior, one in which to this day, I remain weakened.  I have absolutely piled on the pounds during these past 12 weeks.  Long gone is the silly weight gain threat of heavy whipping cream.  No, it has been the large-and-in-charge return of the Deathly Hallowed Sugars.

At the outset of this renewed journey is the actualization of my current weight: 295 ½  lbs and my demand for change.  The weight gain is remarkable; I still expect to see in the mirror my leaner figure from this time a year ago, when I weighed 182 lb on November 4 of '21.  The thing is, I'm not worried about not losing weight or even further gaining weight.  I know how to win through of a zero-carb approach  And I know how long it takes from this point: 12 Expeditions—but you better believe it that I'm going to beat my personal records!  It's advice I've given others and now I'm that *Man in the Mirror*.

As it comes to weightloss itself, workouts don't contribute to weightloss.  It's more of a...remodeling process that involves gaining a more effective weight while serving as a reminder of the overarching goal.  So much of the weightloss process is just the zeal for staying on track.   A fitness regimen keeps things on task while producing an endorphin byproduct of funzies!  It's all about focus with meditation, visualization—all of that.  It's why I have success in running a website while losing weight:  I spend time thinking about what works and what doesn't.  And while a Facebook return isn't a pinnacle objective for me, it would be fun to reconnect again to the people along the way.  

And while FB doesn't serve as a visualization goal of the future, we do need one as a catalyst to break from one system and enter another approach.  Losing weight just to lose weight is...anticlimactic at best.  For example:  my squeezing into those 33-inch Levi's in 2021 that  I bought back in Christmas 2011 was a "now what?" moment, a championship trophy.  It wasn't a horizon, but an endpoint. It's critical to understand that dropping weight is just correlated to our daily life and NOT a special one-time approach, powered by the will.  It's why I return to carnivore.  I want to live the ribeye life.

...and now I slide on my Quest 2, both metaphorically and literally as I start a VR session of Beat Saber's *Blinding Lights.*
