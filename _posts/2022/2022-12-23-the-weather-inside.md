2 for 1 Manager's Special: here's the second post of the day!

I find that it being 1°F out so we're grounded with road conditions, the house heat went out, there's a frozen pipe for the hot water line and sleeping underneath the kitchen table makes for the perfect setting to begin Piper's *Providence*.  He quotes from Spurgeon:

> I believe that every particle of dust that dances in the sunbeam does not move an atom more or less than God wishes—that every particle of spray that dashes against the steamboat has its orbit, as well as the sun in the heavens—that the chaff from the hand of the winnower is steered as the stars in their courses. The creeping of an aphid over the rosebud is as much fixed as the march of the devastating pestilence—the fall of … leaves from a poplar is as fully ordained as the tumbling of an avalanche.  
> ...  
> Providence says, Whatever God ordains must be; but the wisdom of God never ordains anything without a purpose. Everything in this world is working for some one great end. Fate does not say that. Fate simply says that the thing must be; Providence says, God moves the wheels along, and there they are.

Yes, there remains a reason for even this winter waste—err, wonderland.  This morning, I shimmied out of bed at 4 AM to quietly read my Onyx, giving my blanket away to my son, my toboggan hat to my 8-year-old and my secondary blanket to my other daughter.  Maybe this is the first of many 4 AMs to enrich my life?  

Around 5:20 AM, my toboggan daughter and I had a lovely chat, sitting down in front of the blue-flamed fire.  I even snuck her a Lindor truffle.
