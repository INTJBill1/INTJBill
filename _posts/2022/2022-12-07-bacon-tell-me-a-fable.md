I suppose I wouldn't be me if when arguing the strengths of one position, I flip the next day to consider the strengths of its opposite the next day.  Perhaps that's the freedom of the INTJ, that we can navigate life's Fords and Chevys to find a Toyota.  But, I'm not going to do that here today!  "No, no no, no."

OK, real quick:  if I want to post words, I run Jekyll.  If I want to run a place that feels like a hub of activity to me, that promotes my weightless approach, I gotta go with Wordpress.  Its just *feels*...alive?

And maybe the tension I have is found in everything I've written.  I begin seeing what I write from a historical perspective as I have the words I wrote 20-25 years ago now on this siteâ€”how can I not view it from that context?  So, I think long term, what sticks around?  Well, text files, of course.  I mean, I suppose I could convert a doc file from 1994's Office 4.3 though I bet I'd have to use [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) to pull it off (LibreOffice is the grandkid to StarOffice of that same era).  But, I shouldn't view that way with my public facing stuff.  I'm not preserving this for my rocking chair.  Content that has value ought to be put into one (very long) document.  No, I shouldn't be affected if a Cylon hacks this site and replaces my content with actual toaster uploads.  And yes, I have backups but that's not the point: there's short-term purpose and then that other thing.

The thing is, after I figured out how to setup Jekyll on NearlyFreeSpeech (and I posted those instructions on this site), it's not difficult for me to...

1.  Spin up my text editor, throw a few words down and match the Markdown schema;
2.  Upload that file via SSH with FileZilla;
3. Log back into the terminal to run my shell script to move  a couple of files and render the site.
4. [Dance like Tom Cruise in *Tropic Thunder*](https://youtu.be/7PFeJJYMxbw?t=94).

But, this isn't about simplicity.  It's about role and how this site may augment my existence.   I don't write for external customers.  None of that Instagram "shiny happy people holding hands" nonsense!  I think that's like it when I run my weightless graph showing those rollercoaster rides.  It shows that I fail and yet...well, there's a good reason why we love *Rocky*.

And I ought to be sensitive to design things like viewport and whatnot, but...I dunno, I'm getting too old for this sheet of style.  Let some of the young bucks fool with that for web standards have all the stability as a tissue paper; when I pick up a mechanical pencil, it still functions like one from 1990.  As it relates to the Internet, well, remember when frames were all the rage?

Back on point: But, this isn't about simplicity.  It's about role and how it may augment my existence.  And hey, 2023 is almost upon me:  it's going to a be a special one.

Today's album continues into that first year of college and remained a theme throughout:  [Robert Miles *Children*](https://open.spotify.com/album/5QPEiKncTuVzgtrZ6inc6C?si=cHwHV0sARRqMOLpCUpMmag).  It reminds me that the period was more than the tropes and stereotypes held for that era.  It's like how we perceive the '60s as a bunch of dirty hippies.  In reality, there was a lot more horn-rimmed glasses with suit and ties.
