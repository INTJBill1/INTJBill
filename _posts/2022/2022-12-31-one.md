With the last day of 2022, I release an updated version of my site!  OK, so you might think, "It sure looks an *awfully* like the old one..." Just TRUST me, there was a LOT of work done under the hood!  

First, I pulled all the _includes pieces into one default.html...OH SILLY ME, that means NOTHING to YOUâ€”that's just what the gnomes do behind the scenes!

OK, so things on the front end:

* Wider page for content (not practical for phones) with retaining text length restriction for posts;
* Responsive navigation (for phones);
* Somewhat responsive tables (for phones);
* Breadcrumbs added;
* Table of contents for select pages added;
* Link styling that now includes a heads-up for off-site;
* Diary and Poetry indexes can now break up into 3 columns;
* Reworked styling specific to poetry pages.

...and there's a handful of bits that I did, but *\*shrug\**, I don't remember.

I'm really *proud* of my *Destination '23*, my take on the New Year Resolutions.  It took DAYS to create, not for the design or the words, but for its ideas and implementation.

I choose... 

...to activate things that worked well in 2020;  
...to achieve things I failed to do in 2021;  
...and to do what I should have done in 2022.  

Yes, I'm going on an [adventure...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ6u7nlgWps)
