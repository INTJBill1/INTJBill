I intended to write on some more influential albums from those days at the Mug, like *City on a Hill: Songs of Worship and Praise*, POD's *Alive*, or some early David Crowder Band.  I wanted to go from 2002 into 2003 when I saw the rise of Todd Agnew firsthand at Metro every Monday night at Germantown Baptist to Tuesdays at the Loop at Highpoint, which was followed by his *Grace Like Rain* release and how I'd play it in my first apartment at Georgian Woods.  But, no, I'm not going to spend time there.  

I'm fast-forwarding things to 2004, a time if there was ever a time of uncertainty in my life, family, career and even where to live.  I sang along to the worship in David Crowder Band's *Illuminate* while heading down the main drag of Flagstaff as I lived the words of Jeremy Camp's heartfelt *Stay* CD.  

In the dark of a pre-dawn, as I was leaving behind my remaining family members and their thrust into Arizona, I said my goodbyes and with only that Chris Tomlin's *Not to Us* CD riding shotgun in that Silverado truck.  I drove into the sunrise of I-40...

...I was alone...and I was hurting, but inexplicably, I knew I HAD to return to my home;  I had to return to Memphis.  Things with my family would never be again like they once were.  Arizona was never me, even if I moved back there on a couple more occasions in the upcoming years.  But, on that morning, the feeling I felt on that early drive, what I felt, is this moving song, *Only You*, off of the previously mentioned David Crowder album:

> And It's just You and me here now  
> Only You and me here now

I had a terribly uncertain future ahead of me and just a concrete bed waiting for me to lay my head.  All I had was trust and a tankful of gas.  Even now...my heart is *moved*...so many miles ago it was.  Many times in my life, for a moment, I wondered why couldn't I be like my peers?  They had their settled-down lives with their mortgage; they all seemingly had perfect lives; they were hired right after college graduation.  They had stability and love.  I seemingly was forever destined for the road. 

But, then I remembered:  God chose my life.  He knew that if I didn't have a Fall 2000 when I had that anti-Midas touch, I would have never experienced the fullness of what an actual relationship with Him is like.  I would have never found a place like the Mug if I had that corporate achievement mindsetâ€”and how this petulant child still wanted it: "Be GREAT in the eyes of men!  Buy the houses, the cars, the clothes!"  Is this really what I want?  Stuff? I love these words from American Dream an album I listened to 2003 from Casting Crowns:

> I'll take a shack on a rock  
> Over a castle in the sand

I had to be broken to be delivered.
