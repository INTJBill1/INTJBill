Today's post features not one, but TWO albums! The setting for these occurs after what I referenced the other day, Aerosmith *Big Ones*. However, it involves that same ol' black, 1979 Ford F-250 truck. Those nights were drives in a late autumn.  The windows were quite literally rolled down while my cab remained toasty from the furnace that was a massive 460 cu in engine block. There were speaker boxes behind a bench seat reverberating the rock of Van Halen's *[5150](https://open.spotify.com/album/5Ew5vOg3PYyT9QUPCrdIZq?si=ARPR8raxStmKO6D6LfApCw)* and *[OU812](https://open.spotify.com/album/3KufjKt0L2EVahGfxOYJhg?si=8823ca9f2d4447b3)*. 

The drive was a nightcap after the warm glow of the family-friendly country club, Casper Creek, an evening of shooting pool and dancing to songs from both a house band and hits like Shania Twain's *[(If You're Not in It for Love) I'm Outta Here](https://open.spotify.com/track/6Lst3nF4McKOTLSLuTvLhw?si=0c7a75b67ec54692)* and John Michael Montgomery's *[Sold (the Grundy County Incident)](https://open.spotify.com/track/0NLBwQBYJhEM9t3KAMPFVR?si=22aabec538424274)*.

I'm going to come off as *Titanic's* Rose, but it's been 27 years, and I can still smell the cigarettes at the front door, see the lights bounce off the darkened ceiling and feel the incandescence of the pool tables all beneath a dome of *Desperately Wanting*. At the end of the evening, I'd hit the door as the chill of the night sharpened my senses. My boots trampled grass and crunched gravel until I broke the silence of the night with my sole clanging with the power of Grayskull onto my truck's running boardâ€”my engine roared like the mighty Battlecat!  As its headlamps shone through the *Midnight Blue*, the five ID lights at the crown of the beast popped on, my orange beacons of masculinity railing against the haze of darkness. As I thundered down those backroads with my Van Halen soundtracks, could life at 17 be any sweeter? *[Feels So Good](https://open.spotify.com/track/2zkZcJD7k5IEAiXop6BUkg?si=3e17c505f94e4de4)*.


And while I do not know if I can find a song more befitting of today's Carnivore, these lyrics are at the crossroad of today and yesteryear:

> U.S. Prime, Grade A, stamped guaranteed  
> Grease it up, and turn on the heat  
> ...  
> Hey, oh me, I been working up an appetite  
> It seems like the harder I work the more my body needs  
>  
> Van Halen, *Good Enough*
