Alas, I thought I would be employing Todoist to achieve what I have set out before me.  I woke up with my eyes set with determination.  I attached labels; I tooled with filters; and a whirlwind of projects filled my mind.  I was ready. I slapped down my five bucks for the month AND...it failed me.  

While the App Store had no qualms with sliding my money into its back pocket, Todoist threw up its hands and said, "You're a failure.  You'll never amount to nothing!"  I just might be paraphrasing there—I don't remember the exact wording of the error message, but I'm pretty sure *that* was it. 

They *do* offer email support, so I bumbled through that...and I received a RESPONSE!  A PERSON!  I *just* might have value to them after all!  Sure, there was a surprisingly level of helpdesk snark in the email, but I had "just a little of that human touch."  

Ahh, ever so sadly, after that initial email from them, they went dark; I did not hear anything more from them after lunch.  So, that evening around 8 PM, I figured that they are principally in business to make money—who am I—and they don't seem too concerned about making that money.  Perhaps, it would be best for me to cut and run into the night.  I mean, if their chief concern isn't concerning, they've got some holes to fix...in my heart.  

Moving on...while I whipped up something in Excel with checkboxes and pulldowns for categories, quite honestly, I'm happy just to revert back to Stickies.  Sometimes the more cloud we throw at something, the cloudier it gets.

The other day, I picked up a couple of selections from Logos for 2023.  One was John Piper's *Providence*:

I also acquired from Logos [*The Complete Works of Stephen Charnock* (5 vols)](https://www.logos.com/product/5952/the-complete-works-of-stephen-charnock).  I picked it out for his *The Existence and Attributes of God*, but for $5 more, I got everything else.  And yes, you can be like me and drop $25, [OR you can get it FREE from Monergism.com.](https://www.monergism.com/existence-and-attributes-god-ebook).
