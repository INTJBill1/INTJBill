Today, I leap into my 8th day of Carnivore. "Gonna fly now, flying high now, gonna fly" to Friday, January 24, 2025 and take the title for my longest diet streak! *Yeah, keto-carnivore freak is dead!*  Yeah, I, uh, I am TOTALLY convinced Randy "Macho Man" Salvage went to the *Back to the Future, Part II* set in 1989, made Biff like a tree, and got out of there with its DeLorean to rip me off [for this YouTube bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG71K9VC0U0).  

Don't discount the value of streaks; I find that they also add an additional incentive to my VR fitness apps.  I put in a second workout last night with Beat Saber, Les Miles and a sparring session followed by a match in Thrill of the Fight.

And as I write these words, these lyrics begin playing from what is now today's album of the day!

> I'm gonna be the best they've ever seen  
> I know I'll win if I give it all I can  
> I won't let go  
> Gotta make the grade, no I won't let go  
> To be the best man, the best man that I can

In 1994, I was enthralled by [Queensr√øche's *Empire*](https://open.spotify.com/album/6jmesEKzKTLAa3oI96jWow?si=5vjO0-BFSUW8dxeX8-qKxA) for the first time from the back of a rumbling, olive green cutlass from the '70s.  In those days, its 11 tracks rocked the space from a cassette.  On that day, we drove to the Germantown Kmart as its closing and we were hoping to score big.  What did I come away with?  A TI-82 and an armful of 5 1/4 floppy diskettes!  Yeah, as Barbara Mandrell (almost) sang, "I was (geek) when (geek) wasn't cool."

And when I listen to *Jet City Woman*, all I can think is, "Why wasn't I apart of the Hellfire Club?"  

It has been quite awhile since I've caught one of Kelly Hogan's videos, so I picked one out last night: [*How To Thrive On a High-Fat/Moderate Protein Carnivore Diet*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfBUWkS1jO8).  I thought it would be everything I've heard before, but her guest suggested an approach that I'm implementing.  Instead of just piling on the meet as needed,  be conscience of excess proteins' conversion to sugar.  And yes, SOMEHOW, SOMEWAY, the guest, Stephanie Person, is 55 years old (Kelly herself will be 44 in January).  I would have guessed Stephanie was 25-30 years younger!  My takeaway from the discussion?  I NEED MORE BACON!
