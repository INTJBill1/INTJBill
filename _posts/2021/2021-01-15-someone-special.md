World Carnivore Month continues!  When I look back on The 17th and consider what is in store for me in The 18th, I realized that for the six weeks that were before and the six weeks that are ahead, involve my consumption of the following:

* 80+ lbs of pre-cooked beef!
* Over 6 lbs of bacon!
* More than 10 cups of bacon grease!

And yes, I'm losing 2+ lbs a week on this diet. A diet that leaves me wanting for nothing and ENERGIZED to take on my New Year's Resolutions of (2) seven 5Ks, (3) chin-ups and (4) Python development.  The other two challenges, the (1) one-year anniversary of carnivore and (5) The Yeard are more of passive goals than something I seek out each day to accomplish. 

The question I ask, "With an input that is constant, will I see similar results at the end of The 18th? Furthermore, when might I predict that this weightloss phase will be over?"  

If I pull it back to a straight line 2 lbs a week, I'll reach my goal in September.  HOWEVER, the weigh-in for The 22nd Expedition is on August 12th, my self-proclaimed, **Adventure Day**, the holiday that is the anniversary of my parents' elopement, my undergraduate graduation, my own elopement and my graduate school graduation. You *know* I'm gunning for August 12 to wrap up this weightloss and celebrate a new phase of my life!
