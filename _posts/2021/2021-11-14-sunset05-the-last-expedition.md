After 25 Expeditions spanning for a total of 1,446 days, I will be retiring the Expeditionary construct on December 16.  From its early missteps as a fasting vehicle through the weeds of a low-calorie, vegan approach (*intrinsically doomed to failure*) and then making the turn toward winning as it launched with an indomitable spirit fueled by keto that finalized to carnivore, I have achieved a place some 149+ lbs lighter with less than 10 lbs remaining before I hit what BMI folks say is normal weight.  

As 2022 is upon us, it is the moment for an end-of-month schema, chiefly as it relates to run times supplanting my focus on the scale.  Though I'm throwing it in gear to do it, I don't think I'll hit my target weight of 163 lbs before New Year's Eveâ€”I'll be close!  For 2022 will not be about weight loss; it will be about composition and performance, something I've LONGED to reach for YEARS.  

Even now, it's a remarkable place I now find myself.  Years ago around Christmas 2011, I received a pair of Levi's from my Mom.  As it turned out, it would be the last clothes she would ever buy for me.  In its time frame, I thought those jeans would serve as motivation to drive down my weight.  In fact, these gray jeans are at the same waist size as the single pair of black jeans I wore back in high school for line dancing, the same season as I was a wrestler.  Now ten years later, I can *just* squeeze into those gray jeans, the only time I've EVER worn anything low rise.  I'm close to where I once was!  Less than 19 lbs away.  

And CLEARLY, when I reach where I was, I'm going to blow that guy's fitness out of the water.  *Tear Down, Build Up*: my vision for YEARS.
