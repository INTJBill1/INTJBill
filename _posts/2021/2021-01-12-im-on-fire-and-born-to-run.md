Though its 23 F out around 8 AM, far lower than recent memory, I'm on fire and born to run!  Today, I had a successful session #2 of my C25K fork.  So that I can get a better sense of my progression, I've decided to track the heart rate numbers for my endurance regimen in [my 2021 sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1knSRQZ9h29korTwlx_wNeDg3mQ7wwNfe-6g9FvqQyi0/edit#gid=776840878).  While I once considered shelving my FitBit since step counts aren't a goal for 2021, my Versa Lite's ability to track specific workouts will play a pivotal role in the upcoming days.  Once I've achieved...well, *something*, I'll shop for a Garmin, but it's got to be a context *far beyond* runs around my property!

Before I think too far ahead, I still need to plan out my 5Ks for 2021.  I really want that St. Jude 5K in December, but beyond that, I've got six slots left to fill.  And yes, I know marathons are everyone's go-to running goal, but its not on my horizon; I have no interest in developing my body into a marathoner's physique.  I'm here to have fun, not channel my inner Rocky to actualize "about how hard (I) can get hit and keep moving forward."

In comparison to past years, I like how my current endurance program builds me to what lies ahead, but isn't the 2 hour slogging program of the past.  Sure, I can pile up those lower-intensity workouts, and I can walk for hours because of them, but since we perform how we practice, I'm glad I'm running.  And at today's 31 minute workout, it frees up the rest of the morning.

That said, I've been struggling to keep up my Python coding at 4AM.  It's just not a solid time for high level thinking.  Sure, it's a great time for planning or meditation, but I *always* feel like I'm running out of time for Python as my workout is on its heels.
