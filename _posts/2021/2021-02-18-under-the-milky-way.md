In yesterday's post, I had pinned my hopes on my completing a workout before writing this post. While I took the opportunity for a quick walk around the yard to take pictures of snow or stated in another way, assess the probability of leaving the house today, I just didn't take advantage of that 4AM hour...or 5AM...or 6AM, even! There's something about the winter or at least a frosty gym that runs counter to my workouts. Instead, I eat about a stick of butter a day via a coffee transport as I continue on my beefy carnivore diet.

I look forward to next week's The 18th's weigh-in; however, I don't suspect it'll be a double-digit loss, but what do I know? Since I'm not moving around, I don't know if I feel lighter; I feel...same. That said, I'm less than three days away from reaching the 90-day mark on this diet, the goal that I've heard is the first milestone as a carnivore. I love eating this way and it has NOT involved a herculean effort like past efforts of sustaining and tracking:1) soy drinks; 2) broccoli, spinach and flax seed crackers; and 3) expensive Vitamin Shoppe supplementation. Yeah, I lost weight temporarily with that low-calorie nonsense while gripping tightly on my faith in the government and corporations in doing the right thing by providing applicable nutritional data. If I think about, that takes on a lot more faith than I have with those two entitiesâ€”they're not exactly the bastions of truth, are they?

What makes more sense is for me to do what we did before there were governments and corporations, or even the system of agriculture. The problem with our continued move into a virtual existence is our increased isolation to what is real. We just sit up in stands while the game is chosen and played before us. I think we're led to our outrage/sympathy as opposed to getting there on our own, which makes me wonder if a dystopian world involves less neon than what movies have portrayed.

All of that is too big for me. I just seek authenticity.
