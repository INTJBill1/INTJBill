As introduced in yesterday's post, I'm on the verge of releasing my new theme for this website.  It's beginning to really feel like the websites I once knew.  I broke away from the idea of a dark website since I've labored with a Retrowave style for years, though I did go so far as to capture the hex color codes from a "Wake up, Neo" screen capture.  No, today, it's a white background all the way for me, to the contempt of my eyes. 

I'm now left to consider whether I want that blessed Web 1.0 look or should I adopt a MLA vibe?  Ultimately, the decision rests on whether I can go back to a serif body font.  My astigmatism likely will have something to say at the meeting.

One delightful aspect of making a major break from my theme, is that I feel empowered to write more.  In these recent years, especially 2020, I chose to basically write about my personal fitness, i.e. diet & exercise.  Without more formal knowledge, I've pretty much exhausted the subject.  

And as I remain injured, I'm not exactly generating new content over here!  I've now got this weird thing on the same arm as my injured left elbow that I can only describe as a sudden, sharp grip on my tricep near my shoulder.  Sometimes, it occurs when I stretch my arm over my head or cross it along my body, like [an inside block in Taekwondo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKfimAcKL5w).  There's gotta be some sort of correlation with the elbow, though again, I feel it in my tricep very close to my posterior delt.

Maybe it's time to write more on...well, ANYTHING, not unlike when I was youngerâ€”I'm still that guy, I've just become more guarded over the years.  I think, too, that I wanted to maintain a speaker that was somewhat *constant*, or perhaps it can be better states as consistent.  I wanted to be perfect...  

But, friends, I am not a Cylonâ€”at least not from the same make as the older, toaster models.  I reserve the right to change my mind, as the weight values of information shift.  It's how I've crossed the great plains as a vegan to become a carnivore. Or, how I've evolved from championing Arminianism to humbling myself to Calvinism. 

And I didn't become a Memphis Tigers fan because blue is a superior color to orange!  

I make mistakes.  I say dumb things. I've got callouses to show for all the times I've kicked myself.  The other day, I heard this quote from Dustin Poirer after his second fight with Conor Mcgregor:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;Your coach was right. I canâ€™t forget [the first fight], but I can forgive myself and I have.&quot;<a href="https://twitter.com/DustinPoirier?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@DustinPoirier</a> didn&#39;t forget about his loss to Conor McGregor in 2014; he used it to change the outcome in 2021 ðŸ’¯ <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UFC257?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#UFC257</a> (via <a href="https://twitter.com/ufc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ufc</a>) <a href="https://t.co/UtpJFaRKOp">pic.twitter.com/UtpJFaRKOp</a></p>&mdash; ESPN MMA (@espnmma) <a href="https://twitter.com/espnmma/status/1353260306831716353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 24, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I like that.  I make mistakes and like a George Strait song, I sang, "I like to have that one back" for more situations that I'd care to admit.  But, I move on as I *Restore, Retrofit and Retrowave* across 2021.
