Including today's game, I'm now in the second half of my Memphis Tigers season tickets.  GREAT win today against SMU.  The emotional release with the game-winning intersection at the end was exhilarating!

And while I have a lot of memories wrapped up in and about that stadium and about that stadium (especially as I lived across the country), this very well could be last season it'll be known as the Liberty Bowl.  My knee-jerk reaction was to be saddened until I realized that it'll *always* be the Liberty Bowl to me.

I find the preservation in Europe to be enchanting: folks don't tear down buildings or rename them for whatever is popular that year.  Even after World War II when Germany was obliterated, some cities chose their rebuild to feature new buildings that looked exactly like the old ones!  And there's nothing quite like existing within architecture that has been around for a 500-2000 years or to absorb what it's like to look across Prague or Florence.  It's delightful to feel so small within the context of the past history that took place in the place I now occupy.  

Instead, what do I find when I'm on campus?  They tear the University Center not even 40 years after it was built to replace it with...a University Center.  OK, as this is a tired story, therefore the new has now become old: there's likely a blueprint in development somewhere on someone's desk for the next University Center that'll borrow another Caterpillar's tread to crush warm memories.
