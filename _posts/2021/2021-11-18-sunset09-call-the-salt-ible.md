I may have to rename my little 2GB Ram Chromebook, with its full-blown LM 20.2 Cinnamon edition, as the little engine that could!  While my intent was just to have a quiet place to run FocusWriter with Filezilla, I now have my website running locally.   My main laptop could go completely belly up and I would not miss a beat.  My Inkscape usage would tell a different story, however!

I also installed Gnucash because my current structure is from 2020 and sorely needs some optimization/simplification.  It's really all about having the info at my fingertips to make decisions.  In the past, I thought of it more as a historical thing, to see how I screwed up and make things better.  Now, it's about having info to shape the future.

My OS reports that of the 15 GB of HD space available; I've got 3.6 GB remaining.  Contrast this with my phone's total of 512 GB (and it's 8 GB RAM).  And which device does more work / more output?  That's the thing:  it's never been about the hardware or the software, it's about the driver—err, drive into the night, not the software for the steering wheel!

Though I suspect this speaks to how much I under-utilize my phone!  While through Dex, I can run a "desktop" via a monitor/TV, I hope there will come a day (it's beyond technical) when I can wipe the thing and just have it run as a suped-up mini PC.  At $35, my Raspberry Pi running Retropie outclasses (in spirit) this $1000 thing that costs more than my Nitro 5 laptop.

## Salt

Make no mistake about it: I am a big fan of salt.  Back when this weightloss run was vegan-powered with my technical approach through a paid membership with [Cronometer.com](https://cronometer.com/), I restricted my salt down to 200 mg a day because...well, I guess the thinking of that sort of diet is that if you enjoy it the least, it's GOT to be the healthier option, *right*? By contrast, in recent weeks, I'd toss back a couple of pinches of kosher salt as soon as I wake up or just whenever the mood struck.  

*Sidebar: Further (as by a country mile-wide further) by contrast, a couple of nights ago, I ate a package of bacon and saved the bacon grease for my ground beef the next day.  I did the same last night for today.  I just needed fat and haven't had bacon since moving to Memphis, something that was once a daily part of my regimen, just not at that AWESOME quantity.  Afterward, I felt rejuvenated.  And I don't care HOW much flaxseed I used to wolf down each day, I never came away from THAT satisfied.*

At this point in my life, I really don't know how much salt I want.  Lately, I've been makin' it RAIN salt, but I get a sense that life has been over-seasoned.  And while I considered just to run a system to stop adding salt—I have no qualms with its implementation—perhaps the better course of action is to salt-to-taste or salt-to-DESIRE.  Early on, I recognized that a carnivore diet's strength is about reading yourself instead of reading up something typed up with a system font—well, after I was established anyway.

Of course, sure, at the outset of any diet, what we really want is a doughnut.  Today?  *I've got the (shakin'), the (shakin') for bacon. / All your bacon are belong to us!*

Or, is it salt?  That's the tricky thing about salt, however.  My sense of appetite can be toned down from it.  And perhaps the biggest threat of bacon, 'cause I've got to SHOVE THAT IN MY MOUTH.

At the end of the day, the proof is in the pudding, right?  If running meat audibles didn't work...well, mmm, gimme that *(sigh)* Spinach. Oh, I rode WAY too much in 2018 and 2019 Spinach rides; that whole line just spins out-of-control right into a ditch!  Every time. As far as these *supercars* and others like it, you'll find me driving behind the rumbling-with-power, affordable wheel of a 2021 Beef Liver.  Anybody check out the 2022 Beef Bone Broth? Is the Beef Oxtail still out of reach?
