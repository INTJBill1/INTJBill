In amusement this morning, I considered adding a content-rich section of my site by adding all the dings I've been contending with in these early weeks of 2021.  I thought I was out of the woods with my knees until a quick jaunt out to the mailbox yesterday rendered a tightening up behind my knee just like what I experienced in my showstopping workout.  I also: 

1. Contend with a left arm that makes popping sounds when I do a press under stress; 
2. Experience a weird tightening up in that left forearm in random applications, the forearm equivalent to a finger that needs to be popped; 
3. Find when I rise my left arm over my head, my shoulder instantly tightens up; 
4. Forever reminded by aches from what I think is a broken left foot from January 2019's personal daily best of 50,000+ steps on Fitbit; 
5. And frown as my right eyelid still occasionally twitches from that time when grease leaped out from the skillet and stuck the landing...in my eye.  

Well, I've got another to add to the list: my right ankle.  There's a sharp pain on it that has left me largely immobile today.  But, you know, who cares about the losses?  All I want to do is win.

I'll concede that emotionally, the collective body of work these dings have been dragging me down.  I'm in the last 20 lb stretch of going below the 200 lb threshold that it's been unnerving to not enjoy this space.  

But, I've got good feelings for the future, such perfect days lie ahead. 

Today, I added a little bit of dairy into my carnivore diet.  I exhibited Kerrygold butter to my beloved Coffee at a ratio of 1 tbsp per 8 oz.  Now four cups into this rich euphoria, it continues to be a deeply satisfying time together, especially in context of an instensely gratifying 2 lbs of beef roast as presented to me by the Instant Pot, all within the the backdrop of my Eternity for Men scent.  

I don't have my feet, my knees are tenuous at best and my left arm is a glass cannon.  But, I still have my right arm and a killer core. I feel good. It's time to make a run!
