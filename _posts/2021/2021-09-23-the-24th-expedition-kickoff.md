It's that time again when I climb the scale and share the outcome of the last 6 weeks.  **I lost 7 lbs**, putting me at 190.5 lbs.  It's a **3.54%** drop.  Check out the [Status](/status/#weightloss) page to see its relative position.

I wish I could say I earned it, but frankly, I didn't do much as my training remains in a free fall—how its metallic clank echoes down into the coffers of a late night.  That said, the past two Expeditions mark the greatest combined percentage loss of any other duo since my becoming a carnivore.

What was the shape of The 23rd Expedition?

* 28 lbs of Ground Beef;
* 14 lbs of Beef Liver;
* 4-6 lbs of Fish;
* 112 Eggs;
* 28 tbsps of Dried Egg Whites;
* 30+ sticks of Butter;
* 300+ cups of Coffee.

While I previously hosted my domain email with ProtonMail in Geneva, I made the switch to Berlin's [TutaNota](https://tutanota.com/) at €12/year, a price point that is persuasive for a guy that just wants privacy in this digital age of ubiquitous snooping.  While I must be missing its branding's German significance for it sounds Polynesian to me, I do say I respect its clean interface.  And I gotta admit, it's FUN sending an encrypted message to a Gmail recipient!

I tried getting back to Windows 10, but just felt...*icky*, as I was removing all that closed-source, corporate  gunk that clogs the lines.  I thought I might try anyway, in preparation for Windows 11 release to the public in October.  I was curious as to whether the new version would move on or embrace all the bloatware I was removing via [bloatbox](https://github.com/builtbybel/bloatbox) and PowerShell wizardry.  Yeah, no surprises here: "Get in my belly!"

I decided to look up to see what features Windows might deliver in this release; Microsoft made my eyes roll back so hard that I nearly knocked myself out!  I can't get past words like "safe" and "inclusive" without audibly blurting out a nonsensical syllable in disbelief.  Linux, yes, but Windows?  WAIT, we're talking about factors that have NO relevance to things of a technical nature—like being closed source while chock-full of zero-day exploits with a guest key for the NSA to kick their heels up on the sofas of OUR computers...gotcha, so "features" with no actual bearing on a decision for implementation?  I see what's going on here:  just more politics.  Well, I like *safe* and *inclusive* ribeye as much as the next guy, I guess.  Just make sure its medium rare, ok?

Last night, I gave the [Android Debug Bridge (ADB)](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) a whirl.  I gotta admit, I get frustrated by Big Tech's tendency to own my device, making it difficult by default (if not impossible as I look over at my iPad's updated to a desolate bog) to remove apps.  And it's not something that's central to the functionality of the system, either!  It's dumb stuff—like an Internet browser of all things!   While I'd love to replace the os altogether like I did years ago for an iPod Nano, between my evading Google logins and using other app stores, adding the ability to delete everything I want makes my phone start to feel like my own, instead of merely borrowing a service.  [This is the kind of stuff I did last night.](https://technastic.com/remove-samsung-bloatware-safe-to-remove-apps/)
