With my return to Facebook, last night, I achieved the first of my New Year's Resolutions(#4).  OK, I know what you're probably thinking, "Good job, You! Exactly how many mouse clicks did that cost you?"  Hey, that "I" in INTJ might be applicable here—well, insofar as it relates to what I share.  This site is different, of course, as I don't expect much traffic from Facebook to stop at this exit; I mean, this isn't much of a truckstop on the *information superhighway*! And yes I know the '90s called—AND **I** want it back! Fine, lemme look to see if I've got a GIF somewhere in the back...bleh, I've just got that dancing baby and a *Netscape Now!* banner.

After the zombies ravaged 2020's landscape to the present day, it is *good* to see people thriving.  I've been away from it all and despite my turning off the news media, corruption seeps into the soul and  taints our hearts.  If news was merely a play announcer, I'd be onboard with it.  But no, it's far too much John Madden: too much commentary, editorial, opinion—whatever you want to call it.  Then there's this weird, popularity/snowball reaction that occurs with the content providers creating/highlighting that which drives revenue.  In essence, as profit is what makes news and news shapes peoples' worldview, our societal beliefs are ultimately determined by profit.  I know, that's wacky stuff from such a ratings/relative truth, pop news anchor.  Fickle in a pickle! SMH

However, this is out of our domain isn't it?  I mean, yes when the *IT Crowd's* Elders of the Internet bestow upon me the title of *Overlord of the Galactic Enterprise of All E-Named Planets*, I'll shore up the weak spots.  But since that day has been rescheduled, we're stuck with what we have, this blind, mindless Cylon bumping against the walls of life's maze.

Perhaps we don't have to ride the back of that robot. We can be humans again.
