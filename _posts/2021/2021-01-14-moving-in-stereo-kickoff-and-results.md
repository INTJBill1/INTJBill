While I came short of my lofty expectations of 20 lbs in these last six weeks, I did lose 14 lbs, weighing in at 223, a 6% loss.  By both in pounds loss and %, I beat the 14th, 15th, and 16th Expeditions.  But, that initial weightloss bump that The 13th had in its favor is too hard to overcome—I knew it would be, so it was an unrealistic for me to think I could seriously challenge it.

Not bad for a satiating diet of bacon and beef! Pass the bacon fat, please.

And while I love my new numbers, that was The 17th—great job by that guy who did that!  Now, it has become my target to beat. 

Thus begins day 1 of *The 18th: Moving in Stereo*.
