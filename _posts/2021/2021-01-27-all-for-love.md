Over here on the dev side, I've been playing with a new style for this website.  I've had this retrowave vibe through both Jekyll and WordPress installs for over 3 years now—admittedly, it's become a well-worn leather glove. 

However, I'm considering on making a break into something new, which would be something old.  A part of me has an appeal for the way the Web once was:  white background, black Times New Roman text, and blue hyperlinks.   But, I've NEVER liked the soft wraps at the display's edge, perhaps it went unnoticed in that world of 640x480 or maybe 800x600...well, I speak of those days of the '90s, not the evolving Tech Noir of today.

I'm also thinking something simple, terminal-esque—something inspired by 1999's *The Matrix*.  I still want to use Jekyll, but I no longer want to color atop somebody else's theme, in this case, the excellent Minimal-Mistakes.

The great thing about a site like this is that there's no pretension, no master plan to drive ad revenue—no ads even, for that matter!  Sure, I could leap into monetization  and with a singular focus for aggregation, talk about all the intricacies of...recycled crayon sculptures...custom fire ant capitals...a five-selection DIY Starbucks Coffee on tap.  The Internet is made up of a billion just like these each just as credible as the next!  

And yet...I don't find this incentive compelling.

Anymore, whatever I scribble on this piece of paper is as legit as anything else we find out here.  For this, it's hard for me to hand over much credence to someone who shakes their sheet so vigorously that it compels a mob to grab a hold of it and *monkey see, monkey do*.  First, lemme read it!  Chances are, most of all the good stuff is left unnoticed behind a paywall like JSTOR or wherever, while we get all jazzed up over somebody's bedazzled notecard!

If I'm not doing this for money / power, why do I write?  For the love of the game!
