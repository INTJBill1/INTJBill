I'm just came back from Downtown Memphis, specifically the Bass Pro Shop at the Pyramid.  I gotta admit, I always come away from that store wanting to kill something out in the wild—it's a feeling that is so *delightfully* primal!  In time, hunting/fishing may become an avenue of interest, but not while I remain of the city.

While there, I picked up a couple bags of coffee, Black Rifle Coffee Company's [Basic Batch Pumpkin Spice](https://www.basspro.com/shop/en/black-rifle-coffee-company-basic-batch-pumpkin-spice-ground-coffee) and its [Gunship](https://www.blackriflecoffee.com/products/gunship-coffee-blend?_pos=1&_psq=gunship&_ss=e&_v=1.0&variant=39292173353069).  In 2020, I briefly subscribed to their service, specifically for its [Murdered Out dark roast](https://www.blackriflecoffee.com/products/murdered-out-coffee-blend?_pos=1&_psq=murdered+out&_ss=e&_v=1.0&variant=3921242115).  At the time, I didn't stick with it—FedEx was ATROCIOUS where I lived out in the sticks. This time, I'm hoping living in its global headquarters might render better results?

Along with a subscription, I virtually threw a couple bags into my cart, one in which I've been wanting to try out for some time, [its Tactisquatch Roast which has Synthwave/Retrowave written all over it!](https://www.blackriflecoffee.com/products/tactisquatch-roast?variant=39324476047469)!

OK, so you might think I bought it JUST for the packaging...and YEP I DID EXACTLY THAT!

But, my second selection is more than its AWESOME purple vibes, I promise!  I do love this season:  [The Headless Horseman's Roast](https://www.blackriflecoffee.com/products/headless-horseman-ground-12oz?_pos=1&_psq=horseman&_ss=e&_v=1.0&variant=39582663278701)

If there's one thing I know, I'm in-sync with its graphic designer!

I'm still developing a synthwave version of this site as I gear toward a BIG 2022.  Today, I pulled over an L t-shirt and it looked good.  It wasn't that long ago, was it, when I expanded into a 4XL?
