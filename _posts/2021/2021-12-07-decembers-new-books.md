It occurred to me last night to combine together the above passages by Paul and I AM LOVIN' IT!  It is exceedingly encouraging.  There have been many moments in my life when I wish I had quick access to this audio as it really underscores how my salvation is such a priceless gift...how do I respond to it?  

Earlier, I opened up the wallet to add some awesome resources from the [Logos Free Book of the Month](https://www.logos.com/free-book-of-the-month) and its associated deep discounts.  Generally, the free book every month is pretty good, but I began considering this month's specials when I saw how cheap MacArthur's 4-colume Matthew was, a part of an entire NT commentary set I'd like to have someday.

I wound up walking away with the following for $60 after taxes (OR the equivalent of 3 out of 4 volumes of MacArthur's commentary on Matthew at their regular price):

Harris, Archer and Waltke -  [*Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament*](https://www.logos.com/product/1102/theological-wordbook-of-the-old-testament)

Letham - [*Systematic Theology*](https://www.logos.com/product/176708/systematic-theology)

Kruger - [*A Biblical-Theological Introduction to the New Testament: The Gospel Realized*](https://www.logos.com/product/162621/a-biblical-theological-introduction-to-the-new-testament-the-gospel-realized)

MacArthur, John. [*The Deity of Christ*](https://www.logos.com/product/137476/the-deity-of-christ)

MacArthur, John - [*Matthew, vols. 1-4 (The MacArthur New Testament Commentary)*](https://www.logos.com/product/279/matthew-vols-1-4)

Morgan and Peterson - [*Fallen: A Theology of Sin*](https://www.logos.com/product/54245/fallen-a-theology-of-sin)

Owen, John. - [*Hebrews (Crossway Classic Commentaries)*](https://www.logos.com/product/7573/hebrews)

Sproul, R.C. - [*The Glory of Christ*](https://www.logos.com/product/193/the-glory-of-christ)
