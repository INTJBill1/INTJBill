While 2021 is just launching off the Earth, my workout streak is over.  Last night, I pivoted on my right patella which immediately responded with excruciating pain.  It's one of those rare moments when I achieved singular focus: this time, of PAIN.  I massaged the demons back to their fiery crypt and sought my old friend of sleep. 

When I woke up this morning, I could *feel* something different, but greenlighted it nevertheless, until I just *had* to move it at a different standing angle and felt a sharpness, imparting a dull reminder that has been present since.  So, for those of you keeping score at home, it's now a tweaked right knee and left elbow!

That pretty much is the proverbial last nail in the coffin for my workouts...HOWEVER, I've always liked the zombie genre...

> You hear the door slam    
> And realize there's nowhere left to run    
> You feel the cold hand    
> And wonder if you'll ever see the sun    
> You close your eyes    
> And hope that this is just imagination, girl    
> But all the while    
> You hear a creature creepin' up behind    
> You're out of time    

Where will 2021 take us?  Hold on, my friend!  My seven 5K goal isn't over, I'm just pausing the workout to heal and honestly, like I posted the other day, I already knew that I should weigh under 200, ideally 180 lbs, before I kick off a running regimen.  I can fight through a run, but it's like hauling a backpack of bricks.  It's not the best context for these 42-year-old knees;  it's not the time to flip on the afterburners.

Fortunately, the driver of my success continues in January's WORLD CARNIVORE MONTH!
