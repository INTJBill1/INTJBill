I'm feeling pretty good:  after a weekend wrestling match with Windows 10, I return to Uma.  I let the fear of creating a new, Inkscape-to-Circut workflow alter what I really want to do.  Of course, I never run Microsoft in a vacuum for that third wheel of Google presses his face against the glass.  And YES, I've written WAY too much on this topic, so I'll end ALL discussion on it for the REST of this year because I have CAST my Google account out of my life!  LET THE COUNTDOWN TO MY MARKED-FOR-DELETION VEHICLE BEGIN!

May my companion reach Suto'vo'qor to battle aside with its beta elder!  Long were we travelers together.

I'm kinda stoked:  I tore haphazardly through the fonts on my laptop and ths OS still seems to function!  Fonts are one of those things that can get under my collar!  Some rapture me in delight—like Benguiat; then there is Comic Sans, a font that ought to be pushed off my platform onto the oncoming deletion train!

 For whatever reason, font removal isn't as much of a nonissue as it really ought to be—fonts are just clothes for text!  Anyway, I got [my inspiration from this 2019 forum post](https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?t=286734) (a little risky since it's from an earlier OS).

Right now I got this:

```
$ du -d 2 /usr/share/fonts
4316	/usr/share/fonts/truetype/ubuntu
4244	/usr/share/fonts/truetype/liberation2
2096	/usr/share/fonts/truetype/liberation
2824	/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu
13488	/usr/share/fonts/truetype
13496	/usr/share/fonts
```

*(and of course, I ran this thereafter and let the hilarity ensue:)*

```
$ sudo fc-cache -fv
```

...and I've got an armload of Google Fonts waiting in the wings to drop in /.local/share/fonts with some choice beauties off of [DaFont](https://www.dafont.com/) and [1001 Fonts](https://www.1001fonts.com/).

...which, when you combine THAT with the earlier bits on fonts and Cricut, you'll get a sampling of what's going on in my head:  this past weekend I finished up my first t-shirt for my upcoming racing schedule!  It came out AWESOME!  I look forward to sharing it on October 31.  I like its content & context, something I hope to hit for all 7 races this year.  I'm already thinking of doing something similar for each month of 2022.
