Yesterday, I uploaded my website changes, the whole local instance of it basically.  Suddenly, I was overwhelmed with the thought I didn't want it hosted on GitHub.  I dunno, maybe it's the whole open sourced sharing community and I didn't want a developer to fork my operating system, fix the bugs and release an enhanced version of me with kung fu grip—WAIT that would be awesome!

I toyed with getting Jekyll to run on my webhost, but I don't know if I lacked the patience to finish it or if it was timing out on me.  I didn't have confidence in the docs I found, some of which were ELEVEN years old!   "Grandpa, tell me about the good ol' days in computing back in '10." The great thing about my webhost is that it's notoriously a DIY space. 

Still, it planted a seed in my head to move from an absolutely free webhost in GitHub to make my return to NearlyFreeSpeech—honestly, I'm a sucker for a good play on words!  I've been prodded to a return to WordPress so that I can spend less time on mechanics and more time on creativity.  And for all the love I thought I would have for a return to a 90s vibe for a website, either monitors have changed or my eyes have (the answer to both is a yes).  The problem I have with most websites is that they are like staring into a flashlight.  If monitors were like a Kindle display...oh, but what's next, my living on that fabled Pacific island with those mojito-serving chimps?

So under some sort of time frame maybe the next hour, maybe the next week, I'm moving my virtual planet from San Francisco back to Florida.
