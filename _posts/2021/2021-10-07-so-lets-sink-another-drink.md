In my last post, I did a thing I rarely do on this site: talk politics.  Oh sure, it employed a novel metaphor, but it's a topic I touch rarely, for in practice, people who fume about the way things *ought be done* tend to not actually do anything about improving processes! Now, if the pundits *did* fix things, the whole market about fuming over politics would collapse, so there's a hoard of incentive to NOT change!

This amuses me!  I can be so delightfully cynical!  But, that's enough of politics!  The dreamer inside of me is passionate for SO much MORE!

Sadly, a few days into my Black Rifle Coffee Company subscription, I had to opt out;  I guess I'm just revisiting 2020 in another context because I'm bumping up into the same quality of service!  See, I ordered on Sunday...it's now THURSDAY and I'm still stuck here at the barista counter with that ever-so-unsatisfying "unfulfilled" status.  The thing about coffee is that it's a COMMODITY, right?  Product differentiation is SO narrow that I can trip over a substitution!  For that matter, with the Bass Pro Shop and online order combined, $70 can make a FUN shopping trip at [Upton Tea Imports](https://www.uptontea.com/), a company who chomps on the bit to play hot potato when an order comes in.  

My Billy Idol *dancing with himself* cynic might just get a sense that Black Rifle isn't run by former veterans insofar as they are run by former road crew talkers—you know, the ones that stand around and brag on their hunting trip last weekend while traffic is ALL snarled around them!  

*(sigh)* The thing is, I *want* to support them, but they gotta meet me there.  Shipping boxes should be opened and if its sold on their site, product should already be ready to be pulled.  Hey, I grew up and worked in commercial printing from age 11 into college—you've GOT to get those orders out!  Never did take a family vacation in all of those years...

...this might explain why, not once, but TWICE in my twenties, I quit my job and on the very next day, I was flying over the Atlantic to explore Europe for a few weeks (though I suspect it is due to something SO much MORE...).
