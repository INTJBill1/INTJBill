[The 2021 WOLVERINE Cup Series Schedule](/races/) is outâ€”grab your copy TODAY! And just six days before the first race!  OK, so I'll do a better job of releasing that info on that for 2022, but hey, applaud my turnaround time!  This was just a thing that came out as I wrote on Sept 18's [*From "Bye Bye" to "Born to Be Wild."*](/logs/2021-09-18-from-bye-bye-to-born-to-be-wild/)  

I'm EXCITED about this inaugural season, even if I'll have to cram the whole thing into a box of only TWO months!  Overall, it is a series that is CHOCK-FULL with nostalgia; I look forward to sharing the artwork for each race!

And at absolutely NO ONE's surprise, I'm doing things in an unorthodox manner:  I'm not going to do any training runs before the first race for I want to establish a baseline of performance.  Nope, not a single sandal fluttering!  See, there's the added bonus of turning in an ABSOLUTELY HORRIFYING performance on Halloween hammering home the need for change on Reformation Day.  These aren't singular events, but a series for which I hope to show gradual improvement (with that yummy jar of intrinsic motivation).  As I train, these moments serve as waymarkers, highlights of my progress.
