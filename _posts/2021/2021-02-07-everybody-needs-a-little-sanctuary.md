It's Super Bowl Sundayâ€”WAIT, I better reconsider before hanging the exclamation mark at the end of this sentence.  Once upon a time, it was a day that was special.  I don't know if I grew out of it or the NFL has changed; it's likely a little of both.  As far as football goes, I still love my Memphis Tigers, but it's because of the TEAM; in the past, I liked the NFL because of the individuals.  There's remains a player left in the game whom I admire; he's playing at QB later today.  How can I not root for a guy who is a year older than me?  And it's the same when I was cheering for that same, while much younger, underdog against the vaulted St. Louis Rams in 2002, back when I was less than a year out of college.

There was a time I was an avid NFL consumer.  Through having a guy's night out with a Krystal's run and Monday Night Football combo when I was 16-17, visiting the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton while in college in 2000, hanging out on Sundays to watching games at another's house in my 20s or even during the 2013-2014 season, watching EVERY game that season via the NFL Gamepass, I was once drenched with the stuff.  And don't get me started with Madden or Tecmo Super Bowl on the NES!

But today, I just don't follow the stuff.  The people I cheered for have retired and the teams I once held allegiances toward, the Minnesota Vikings and the Pittsburgh Steelers, are now irrelevant in my life.

Anymore, the Superbowl is a holiday remining me of all the marks on a map I've visited and all of the cherished travelers that shared these sections of the track before the next train station parted our travels.
