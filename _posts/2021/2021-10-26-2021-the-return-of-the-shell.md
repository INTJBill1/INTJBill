It's liver day!  While right now, I'm on a 1 lb daily BEEF:BEEF:LIVER schedule, I wouldn't be opposed to returning to a BEEF:LIVER rotation.  It really depends on the price of ground beef with respect to liver's stability.  

Honestly, I have NO idea why liver is SO cheap, ESPECIALLY as it relates to its nutrition and its relative size in a cow.  Look, how much meat can we get off a cow?  Like 500-600 lbs?  And how heavy is a liver, like 10-15 lbs?  Thus, while I can live for 500 days on that single cow I can AT MOST only eat liver for a couple of weeks.   

And yes, OF COURSE, the occasional ribeye is an awesome-blossom treat!  But, feeding frenzy funzies is where it ends.  You'd think liver would run at those kind of prices! Limited supply AND greater value?  I mean, if there was EVER a recipe for a price hike...thus, when ground beef—GROUND BEEF—spikes above liver, the decision is easy that THIS caveman can do it!

## Grind City
Eggshells are BACK, baby!  In the past, I found their application to be...needy:  boil AND bake?  Who wants to do THAT everyday?

Enter my beloved air fryer: an Instant Vortex 6-quart.  For my diet, I could get rid of every heat source sans the water kettle from my kitchen and stay in rhythm with just my air fryer.  It's my daily workhorse!

So, I grabbed eggshells destined for the trash heap, rinsed and threw them in the air fryer for 6 minutes at 400° F.  I then let an old coffee grinder rip, resulting in a fistful of fine sand.  I tossed a tablespoon of it in my butter coffee and later ate a tablespoon of it straight up.  Upon the initial landing beneath the tongue, it gives that ever-so-delightful *I'M GOING TO DIE* dry note!  It has a hint of a nutty/roasted flavor.  

Why have I added eggshells to my diet?  While it is cheap and adds NO added expense to the budget, it also packs a nutritional HAYMAKER!  Check out this [Dr. Axe article: Can You Eat an Eggshell? Surprising Benefits & Uses of Eggshells](https://draxe.com/nutrition/eggshell/).  For me, it'll contribute to my recovery from my no-go for flight back in May...

...AND/OR from January's vertical climber;

...AND/OR the injury from the deck pull in December;

...AND/OR the build up of a cascade of forearm strikes to the heavy bag before that...

...well, this left arm has taken a 2021 beating!  Let's get to cracking eggs together!
