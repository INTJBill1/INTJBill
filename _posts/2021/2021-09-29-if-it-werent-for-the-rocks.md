I dabbled with a trial of Idagio as I found a workaround regarding the aforementioned lack of PayPal.  While I really like it as a service, it's a shame that they don't provide any information on composers.  Oh, sure, I can fire up DuckDuckGo and cross my fingers that Wikipedia is in the ballpark, but how AWESOME would it be to have quick access to expert info?  For a service that specializes in a genre (especially classical), this is a no-brainer, right?!  

That said, they [don't exactly have a large team](https://about.idagio.com/team), especially as they would just be rotating the tires on work already replicated by other services.  I also found its search engine to be not particularly forgiving, which is problematic when the music genre is largely in other languages than English!  

At any rate, I'm going to be relegated to free streams.  As I write this, it's a classical stream out of Venice.   I ran across another stream last night, like Idagio, out of Berlin, HOWEVER, [this stream](https://www.country108.com/) is from a FAR different genre; it's locus broadcasting just down the road from here!

...and on my Linux box, there's several streams to choose.  Sure, it's nowhere near the sound quality of Idagio but my equipment largely makes that a nonissue.

Another consideration for my pulling back from Idagio is it's simply consistent with what I've been doing the past 9-to-10 years, minimizing my login exposure to the web.  In like fashion, I deleted my LibraryThing account so that I can bring my content over to my own site.  Clattering away as a content chimp is one of my biggest pet peeves with Facebook.  Granted, Facebook is largely a 1,000 monkeys in a room with a 1,000 typewriters.

Plus, it's hard to restrict myself to a single genre as I've really been in the mood for some Sinatra lately.  Or this song, that along with the theme to Top Gun, calls back to my waning moments in the Czech Republic as I was finishing my graduate degree:

I FINALLY finished up Gilbert's *The Second World War: A Complete History.*  It was definitely an autumn march to Leningrad on that one!  I'm just glad to get it out of the way so that I can focus on other studies, something that I'll likely be fleshing out on this site soon.
