This morning, I put in the last workout of *The 17th: The Carnivore*.  I'm *excited* for tomorrow's weigh-in.  I *really* hope to hit 217, making it a 20 lb weightloss for these last six-weeks.  Admittedly, it's an ambitious target, as the prior six weeks was only a 7 lb loss, and the prior two before that were 12 and 11.75 lb losses.  

HOWEVER, *The 17th: The Carnivore* has been completely fueled by beef and bacon!  I would be shocked if it wasn't at least 15 lbs.  But, I just won't know until tomorrow. 

And yes, I relish that it is World Carnivore Month.

I feel good.  I've got a weird elbow injury going on from my time tearing down the deck that I seem to exasperate.  I've pulled elbow strikes from my striking routine and halted my triceps resistance work.  I'm beginning to think I might have to pull striking and lifting altogether outâ€”that would suck.  It doesn't hurt, but there's something loose that pops when I touch it.  There's no restriction of movement or anything, but still I'm wondering what I should pull back from to give it a chance to heal.

That said, I added an additional set to my Maxiclimber today.  Now it's 4 sets of 0:03:00.  Despite it being at the end of my workout, I felt I could have made it 5.
