*Cue Jo Dee Messina's Bye Bye...* 

Likely not surprising my reader in context to my recent posts, I laid the accelerator to the FLOOR and COMPLETELY lost Google and Microsoft in the rear-view mirror of my Linux Mint Cinnamon rig!  I mean, there's nothin' but miles of dotted lines falling off the horizon behind me.  

I feel WONDERFUL to leave all of that spycraft behind as I open my throttle wide in these open-source waters!  And believe me, it feels *GOOD* to not be subjugated to the political rhetoric of Big Tech!  Crank out some Steppenwolf!

The funny thing is that I really didn't tell anyone of my new email addressâ€”oh, sure, I pointed service logins and updated my password manager in kind, but socially, I didn't do anything.  And yes, I did make a reference to the address in a prior post, but not in a direct manner.  Hey, I don't know how good AI  is these days; while it's generally meat-like, Spam has sugar, so along with its absence from my Inbox, it's off my carnivore list!  *(Sadly, because of the carbs that slither into the dehydrator, this is also why I cry over beef jerky.)*

I've made the realization that for me to turn this year into a series of wins, I basically got to treat it like it's 2020 all over again.  It is a *wild* world out there where emotions have trumped logic; it's just not a healthy place for the NT rational! To my knowledge, I haven't reacted with 2020 nightly teeth grinding as I slept, but that can't be far off!

How do I envision closing out this year in applying 2020's lessons?

* Continue this strong push with book consumption in my Blade Runner, Fitness Guru and Entrepreneur paradigm;
* Ignore pop news and the politicization thereof;
* Eat and train;
* Breathe purposely.

Perhaps as I close out this year, it'll mimic the prior year and I'll make another run at Facebook...HOWEVER, the world's gotta SETTLE down for me to be willing to hand a wedge of my freedom over to Zuckerberg's website and all his cookies that are akin to *Stranger Things* Season 2's underground labyrinth!  Honestly, I think I'd just run his place in a closed-off virtual machine if I did!  

The other day, a *great* idea struck me immediately after I was mass-emailed by a race organization expressing how they were no longer interested in my participation:  why not just create my own series of races?  ANYBODY can throw together a route! And it is LITERALLY a sport where you intrinsically do it by yourself!  At the entry price of these things, I can even get a t-shirt printed up for each one!  I was wondering how I was going to get those seven 5K's in this year to resolve that New Year's resolution...this just might work!   It's definitely something I want to steep in some creative juice.
