While it was a unique experiment of mine, I've ultimately gotta give a THUMBS DOWN on my Daily Ten-Minute Internet approach.

Sure, it was NO problem for me to ignore large swaths of the Internet, but I felt like I might introduce errors by the speed for which I was attaining critical data—unless I grab for offline use, which again, really feels like I was running contrary to the spirit of the experiment!  Don't get me wrong, I do like a mental sprint, but in context to my withdrawals from pulling my performance enhancement drug that I'm mention here shortly...well, there's a fear I'd trip and come smashing to the group, not a great thing to do virtually or in 4D space.

Honestly, we really could just do a one dump of data at the start of each day to fulfill our reqs, not unlike a newspaper!  But, it depends on the context of our living, doesn't it?  Trying to connect one manner of living onto another does not snap on without one AMAZING adapter.  

The older I get, the more I recognize that the older ways are best.  Unfortunately, it wasn't the mindset of the fellas in the lab coats who whipped up margarine for the first time.  Ha, healthy—makes me wonder how much of the other 20th/21st century things got it all wrong.  The fact that we built a tech where ultimately only Mutually Assured Destruction was the best path to peace tells me all I need to know about the 20th century.

While it wasn't the first time I removed coffee from my diet, these past couple of days has GOT to be the hardest time it ever was to break the habit.  I suffered MISERABLY in my move away from 6-9 cups-a-day to ZERO, in terms of longing for, a general dissatisfied mood and a ROCK SHOW headache.  It also blows open wide my routine of coffee in the morning, meat for lunch and coffee in the afternoon.  I went from my iced coffee with 2 tbsps of butter for breakfast to 1 tbsp of butter with 3/4 tsp of eggshell—I suddenly felt like I was on an actual restrictive diet!

And now, fully caffeinated, I reference this clip again:

And with regard to the Internet: it's time to open things up and do like the best quote from Rocky II, "Win!"
