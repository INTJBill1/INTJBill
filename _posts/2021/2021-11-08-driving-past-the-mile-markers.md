A mile-marker day for me:  I've built a 200-day beard and hit 350 days on my carnivore diet—just 15 more days to hit the year achievement!  Now, if I want to pull out the yardstick, 350 days isn't particularly mind-blowing, ESPECIALLY when compared to others in the carnivore tribe.  It's really not unlike my 5K times compared to the running community.  However,  they're both big to me:  1) I have demonstrated to myself that meat has all the nutrition I need and my body reflects this as I'm on the welcome mat to returning to the weight I was in high school; 2) I go the distance.

Basically, my mindset is aligned to the following from the *Rocky* series:

> The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It is a very mean and nasty place and it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is going to hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard you hit; it's about how hard you can get hit, and keep moving forward. How much you can take, and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done. Now, if you know what you're worth, then go out and get what you're worth. But you got to be willing to take the hit, and not pointing fingers saying you ain't where you are because of him, or her, or anybody. Cowards do that and that ain't you. You're better than that.

I mean, maybe some of you guys got something you never finished, something you really want to do, something you never said to someone, something…and you're told no, even after you paid your dues?  Who's got the right to tell you that, who?  Nobody!  It's your right to listen to your gut, it ain't nobody's right to say no after you earned the right to be where you want to be and do what you want to do!

## Ground Beef

The Costco ground beef looked so good today raw that infused by a spark of Bear Grylls, I took a couple of bites.  Immediately, I turned toward my cameraman to say how it was packed with protein and loaded with all sorts of /ˈvɪt.ə.mɪn/ that my body needs.  YES, that is the FIRST time I've EVER eaten raw ground beef.  My takeaway was its absence of strong flavor—I can see why it's all about the seasoning when it comes to tartare.

Culinary exploration aside, I missed the flavor and texture of my typical approach, so I mixed in with the rest of that lb a couple of eggs and a tablespoon of egg white powder.  I then massaged it all together and flattened it onto the bottom of my air fryer for 22 minutes, but not before a LIBERAL sprinkling of black pepper, a smattering of No Salt and two pinches of kosher salt.  Halfway through, I flipped and repeated with the salt and pepper.

 And I eat every bit of what comes out of that air fryer!

Ol' George Foreman would shake his head toward me if he got a load of me.  The thing with my diet is that I GOTTA have my fat—it really does regulate hunger!  I can feel the difference a fattier day vs. a leaner one, or even leaner ground beef compared with a fatter one—I can't finish a lb of the higher % variety in one sitting, but leaner?  Sure!  It's funny because we were SO OBSESSIVELY against fat back in the '90s.  Ahh, this amuses me—such is life!  If I may borrow from *Cars*, sometimes to turn left, we gotta turn right.
