I'd have preferred for this to be a race day post.  As I had deleted the race's original SVG design, last night, I grabbed a screenshot off Cricut so that I could trace bitmap an approximate to post here.

It's a simple design and CLEARLY DERIVATIVE of *STRANGER THINGS*, which IT SHOULD BE for it couldn't be anything else!  Sure, it's in terms of taking place on Halloween, but more significantly, it marks not only a 500-day diet streak, but the successful streaks that came before it via the shirt's back.

*STRANGER THINGS* has been a companion across this weightloss ride, whether my playing the synthwave genre throughout or even [season 3's, "One Summer Can Change Everything" poster](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/33/9f/67/339f6728fe28db6d5c4f13d4529c619d.png) that once hung in my gym.

It seemed befitting that for Race 1, the event I looked toward to for YEARS, would feature a *STRANGER* THINGS theme. When I kicked a keto diet off in June 2020, I didn't know where I would land 500 days later or that it would EVER be CARNIVORE for in context, my absolute PRIDE at that point was a low-calorie vegan diet that got to 116 days, breaking the previous record by 22 days, something special before it was squashed by this MONSTER TRUCK RALLY BIGFOOT BEHEMOTH MEGA-DIETâ€”this current streak OBLITERATES all of my past high scores COMBINED.

At what point does a diet become: *it's just what I do*?

Well, it's food for thought...for now, *we're on to Cincinnati*.  Up next: Thursday's weigh-in for The 24th Expedition's results.
