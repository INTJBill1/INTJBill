It's back to Segoe UI for me!  Yes, in another installment of *The Walking Dead*, Redmond emerges from the wilderness when we would have sworn we put him down!  And then from some sort of parallel universe, a worm hole, or in a crossover episode does that Klingon hop over from the other side, too!

It's for the best.  Late last night, I was all sorts of flustered with Cricut.  Perhaps it wasn't my finest hour for long gone are the days when my late nights were nowhere CLOSE to designing T-shirts!  

I set up a virtual Windows 10 environment on my Linux box that left me with a distracting, user experience.  It made me feel like I was 331 lbs again!  I tried to trim things down within the OS; I added a few CPU cores and could only pass out another 500 MBs of RAMâ€”this laptop isn't exactly jacked for that sort of thing!  I probably could have made it work if I pressed, as years ago, I had success with using USB devices on a virtual system (though I wasn't about going to keep my fingers crossed for any sort of Bluetooth functionality).

I was gonna run with it, until this morning when I was running APB against my phone, wiping out all sorts of bloatware nasties: Samsung, Verizon and Google.  I gotta admit, it's a high to delete the Google Play Store;  I mean, if there was ANYTHING that Google would frown on me deleting....I got to the point when I even blew up the MMS app (wasn't my intention). The whole thing got me asking, "what am I doing?"  Just because I *can* doesn't mean I ought to invest the administrative overhead in doing so.  It's the whole scarcity of time bit here.  To what end, really?
