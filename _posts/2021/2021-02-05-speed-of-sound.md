What will the roadmap be for 2021?  Is yesterday's workout catastrophe the shape of things to come?  I still want the things I want for this year, even if I cannot work on them directly for this month.  In context to these years since 2018, a strong showing from my diet regimen in the first four months of a year already puts me into positive territory and I can definitely pivot success from it...

Of course, all of these are simple thoughts that roll around my head that don't have much application a couple of mm's beyond my cranium.  

I'm about to hit 75 days as a Carnivore, which sounds like a lot until you realize I went for 136 days straight on keto until I was [hoodwinked by Sonic](the-house-that-jack-built).  The great thing about where I'm at with Carnivore is I feel like I'm just getting started.  And truthfully, I AM, especially when you consider other Carnivores like Kelly Hogan's 11+ YEARS.  I find what I'm doing now, is SO different from that low-calorie, starvation diet, where just the force of the will brings some sort of stand-in for victory.

On other fronts, I want to pour nutrition into my headspace.  My *New York Times* subscription runs out tomorrow and with it, my desire to know what's going on the world.  What I did in 2020 makes sense: ignore the noise.  It's one big ship of fools sailing out there, all pawing after the helm. Ah, my friends, they don't know "what has been is what will be, and what has been done is what will be done; there is nothing new under the sun."
