## Theme Update

After running a theme I created that was inspired by my Amazon Kindle, I've brought back my retrowave infusion.  While it seems the same as some of the past iterations, under-the-hood, its parts move in more-or-less the same manner as the past.  That said, I TOTALLY integrated my CSS var approach for pretty much everything!  I'm thinking of creating stylesheets for holidays!

I'm proud of a particular bit of code for standardization, something I ran the ball with once I discovered I could throw a variable inside of a variable.  I was gonna post a code snippet below, but why not just check it out yourself!

It's the first time I've employed HSL colors, for in the last *(cough cough)* four decades, I've only used HEX (with some RGB along the way)...

Sidebar: Hey, it's a span covering the '90s, '00s, '10s and today!  Meh if I'm a radio DJ, I'm queuing up the  '60s, '70, '80s and the '90s.

...I made the color conversion out of its practicality:  I wanted to reduce color variability while also allowing me to easily add tints and shades of a single color thereby giving me flexibility AND keeping things consistent to when I throw on a holiday theme!

I *tried* to keep a responsive mindset, so the HTML tables and iframes don't leave the display to go on their own Hero's Journey, but only insofar that my phone perspective doesn't look wonkyâ€”honestly, I have little interest in supporting mobile devices. I mean, what am I doing?  Doing this for 286's?  What, am I gonna have to account for a CGA palette?  OK, so yeah, I just might have a hangup with @media max-widths!

## My Crystal Ball

Something that hit me today:  soon, there will come a future when we we'll see our phones as '90s era beepers; anything running electricity will be an IoT device with its own camera and mic.  You'll NEVER need to take a photo or video of yourself because it'll always be available at the best of angles!

The tech is already out there now, it just needs to reach ubiquity / critical mass.  And as no one cares about privacy, everyone will LOVE and espouse its advantages, just like they do with today's phones!  You have nothing to hide!  Think of the children!  Think of your safety!  Think of citizen non-compliance! Governments will champion the tech for with power, they are a fat man at an all-you-can-eat buffet!  Oh, we covet the dystopian delights of tomorrow, today!

Ahh, I can be so delightfully (and darkly) cynical!

...and right.
