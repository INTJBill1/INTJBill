While I had previously wrote that I was wrapping the Expeditionary construct and just drift down  to goal weight as the eventuality...

...not so fast.

I got a feeling that perhaps I should not wrap things up yet.  It was confirmed by my ABYSMAL weigh-in!  I gained 2.5% (5 lbs).  Honestly though, I think (I hope?) it's just false weight, water brought on by carbs as lately I've been rather indulgent on oopsie cake and all of its heavy whipping cream goodness.  I also find that I had no appetite shutoff for bacon, so I may have to hit its shutoff switch.  And I suspect some hidden sugar in bacon might be in play…

While I hope it is false weight, nevertheless, it irks me.  I thought I had cleared the woods, yet I must ride further through the night.

Thus, I'm making a pivot:  I'm pulling out of my dairy consumption and ending my mainstay of coffee and butter.  I like coffee, though it has made me feel weird of late—9-cups-a-day will do that!  

I'm also zeroing in on beef consumption.  Yes, I LOVED bacon and every drip of its fat, but I don't think I trust its package labeling.  My body's response is just bizarre to me, so I'm dialing it back to what I know wins the day!  

While it has yet to be finalized, you might think that I'd post a New Year's Resolution about workouts, 2022 is not about that.  Hitting the 2nd *carniv-ersary* is the extent of my fitness resolutions.  Heaven is too close at hand for me to invest 2-3 hours day into fitness like I once did.  I ran into these earlier and I really  like them:

> but our citizenship is in heaven, from which we also eagerly wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. He will transform the body of our humble condition into the likeness of His glorious  body,  by the power that enables Him to subject everything to Himself.

> Philippians 3:20–21, HCSB   

> The first man was from the earth   
> and made of dust;   
> the second man is  from heaven.   
> Like the man made of dust,   
> so are those who are made of dust;   
> like the heavenly man,   
> so are those who are heavenly.   
> And just as we have borne   
> the image  of the man made of dust,   
> we will also bear   
> the image of the heavenly man.
