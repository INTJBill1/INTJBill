For October, I hate that I invested most of the month toward deciding whether I want to focus on cybersecurity and privacy with a Linux and Tutanota ticket, or should I hand over my DeLorean keys to some random stranger in California, hoping I won't find any dings in the fender from a valet's joyride.  Topics like these are ones I've used in this space to wrestle over like:  a dynamic WordPress vs. a static Jekyll; using my own host vs Microsoft's GitHub; training regimens; diet regimens; and social media involvement!  Like a Bourne fight scene, papers fly as I madly wrestle with what direction is best.  Fortunately, my cybersecurity focus seems to have won out over the wide-open standards and I'm sure something is up on the horizon for my consideration.

Honestly, the more the world is becoming infused with tech, the more I'm finding ways to unplug.  Sure, I *can* do it for I did it when friends were staring at their beepers on a Friday night while listening to Pearl Jam and John Michael Montgomery.  But again, *just* because I *can*...

I continue to drop my account login total.  I've abandoned my Brooklyn Public Library along with the other two libraries.  For one, despite the 248 audiobooks I tore through summer last year and picking up again some this year, I'm weaving more toward a singular focus.  Book consumption gets to a point where it just feels like a rat race!  

That said, I'm also ABSOLUTELY punting the Brooklyn Public Library because of its politics.  Look, what do I want out of a library?  "Gimme that tome, you humpback!  Take this book back, you bespectacled cat lady!"  I have no need for "social programs" or computer labs or—well, whatever the cool kids do these days—but, I ESPECIALLY DO NOT WANT MY LIBRARY TO CHANGE THE U.S. CONSTITUTION!  I guess revising your late fees policy was a handful of Meamucil to get ya going!

Geez, talk about high achiever's overreach...yes, and next week I'll be opening a Chic-fil-A franchise on Jupiter.  In other news, Bob the Builder will be restoring the UK to the EU.

Yeah, "it's a very, very mad world."  But, there's no reason for me to get all caught up with it.  Honestly, I don't have anything to do with it!  Like the spirit of 2020, my interests lie in the news of MY world.  Yes, long gone are the stories about the feral cat, the ground hogs and the redneck fire of concrete explosive POWER—and today's tech news has GOT to *simma down na*, but it's the sort of things I want to read about, for it's **the sort of things I can change.**
