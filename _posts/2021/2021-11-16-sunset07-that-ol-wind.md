I write this post from my repurposed ASUS CB3-131 Chromebook with its lovable, hardy case—even its keyboard is a delight—running the same OS as my main box:  Linux Mint 20.2 Cinnamon.   While priced today on eBay for $47, this Chromebook rolled off the assembly line on March 15, 2016.  Again, it's bewildering to me that Google chooses to no longer send security patches to still-relevant machines.  It's not like these boxes are paper towels to be thrown away!

Compared to when I built my machine from parts picked up at a computer expo at the Agricenter: an AMD 350 MHz, with 2 GB hard drive running Windows 98, I would have ABSOLUTELY SALIVATED to have run across these specs back in 1998: 

* CPU: 2.16 GHz Intel Celeron
* RAM: 2 GB 
* HD: ‎16 GB SSD

Now, that 1998 machine had a Voodoo II 3D-only card that I picked up for $300 ($513 in 2021).  I also primered and painted its case with colors that were VERY RECEPTIVE to black light!  I loved that thing!

All of that aside, what Google cast away has inspired me.  I'm running FocusWriter and dropped in Filezilla to update my site.  I may eventually just put in Jekyll to run a local copy of my website.  Not just fully patched, but this little Chromebook also has FAR more capabilities than when it bounced down the line new!

And while I could install Brave (or Chrome—just out of spite), both browsers go a tad above the CRAZY-GO-NUTS threshold as it relates to RAM—SERIOUSLY, do I really need to pull 1.5 GB of RAM to make a quick run through the Net?  At 2 GB, the only way I could run my OS is to go back in time....I remember back when I needed 128 MB for Windows 2000 and 256 MB for Windows XP—I could lament on this, but I'll table that discussion for now.

This isn't my browsing box, so I ran down a copy of Seamonkey as it seems to be one of the lighter browsers out there sans the text browsers out there (I do have my limitations).  I just need something to quickly grab info.  There's also a nostalgic feel that makes it charming.

And while I tried several lightweight distros before returning to my default, none of them felt *right.*  It's really all about the interface to me, like, does the track pad move naturally?  The Linux Mint team has spent some time polishing its flagship and its attention shows.

## Water Drop?

For the rest of this year and throughout 2022, I have set a daily target to drink 4 liters of water per day—ideally carbonated water!  Since becoming a coffee-drinking carnivore, water consumption just has not been a focus.  I can do better.
