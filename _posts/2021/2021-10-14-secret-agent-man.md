In my last post, I wrote how I submitted to Big Tech's hegemony.  It was never set well within me; my phone and laptop were no longer my own; prowlers sifted through my things.  I bristled—and yet, if I'm adopting the [Cricut](https://cricut.com/en_us/) universe (AND I REALLY HAVE), *shouldn't I bend the knee to the cybernetic monoliths?*

Last night, after updating, installing, loading tools, enabling a theme, and cleaning up Windows 10 with stuff like [the ever-helpful community version of Bloatbox](https://github.com/builtbybel/bloatbox), it hit me that on a subconscious level, I had spent HOURS molding Windows 10 to look and function like Linux Mint 20.2 Cinnamon. When I took a step back and saw this, I laughed and knew what had to be done.  And since [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) runs more smoothly on Linux, I would only need the MS/Android/iOS software to connect to the hardware and ignore the Cricut editor's *limited-functionaity-with-a-high-dollar-price-tag-for-content* app.  I would find a way to make the connectivity work even if I had to [grab a Microsoft test VM](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/) (I would later apply Cricut's iPad app).

Now, I'm not a strong Inkscape user.  I've always been more of a raster graphics guy: Gimp, Photoshop, Jasc Paint Shop Pro and a litany of others.  It amuses me that I spent more time with an application like Inkscape when I was 12-14 than I did in all the years thereafter.  I just looked into it: CorelDRAW still exists these days; it's like a taste of a lost childhood memory, one of the few, remaining vestiges of a childhood-to-adulthood transition in a backdrop of commercial printing...

*(I miss the aroma of [commercial printing ink](https://vansonink.com/products/), something that once was as common as smelling supper before a family meal.)*

While vector graphics aren't a strength of mine, it's gonna be in my wheelhouse soon.  On YouTube, I ran across [*Inkscape Ultimate Quickstart Guide for Beginners: How to Use Inkscape Course + Tools Tutorials*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=girjT1RlShM); it seems to provide a promising overview for me to explore further.

My time on Windows wasn't a complete loss for I found a fun theme for Chromium-based browsers: [Cyberpunk](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cyberpunk/ekkfihjmcoeplagmladakeignpdaecmc).  Run it!  It flows naturally with my current site design.

And yes, I'm back on email with my own domain name, something I really enjoy!  I really do prefer [Tutanota](https://tutanota.com/) over ProtonMail (CLEARLY more than Gmail).  Knowing that I've paid €12 for the ENTIRE year and *I'M DONE* is a comfort, compared to the monthly $5 hanging over my head each month with PM.

Lastly, I share this clip off of YouTube.  I ran it on my TV last night as I worked.  It is mesmerizing and analogous to 2020's meditation work. This FEELS like an Expedition.
