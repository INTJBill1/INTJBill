It's now less than 6 days before I climb atop the scale to weigh in for *The 17th Expedition: The Carnivore*.  I'm hoping for a 9.1% loss which would be the top mark for 2020, but I don't know if I have it in me since I've been losing weight since June.  To put into perspective, it's been:

* The 13th: 8.3%
* The 14th: 4.5%
* The 15th: 4.6%
* The 16th: 2.9% - *This would have been 1.2% if I hadn't started Carnivore for its last 9 days—yes, I lost more in 9 days than the prior 33.  The weird thing is that, until The 17th came around, I worked the hardest in the gym during The 16th—I even made its playlist specifically for training!*

At any rate, a 9.1% loss would be around 20 lbs for me, putting me at 217.  I *feel* fantastic and notice visually my sudden, physical changes; I dropped out-of-nowhere into XL shirts.  Crossing the 220 milemarker is huge as I've only done that twice since 2018 and those two points were followed by a LONG ride up the scale.  Unlike those two instances, I don't feel deprived and more importantly, I still feel like I'm just getting started.  Which...I am, in context of being an athlete.  I'm an old hand at being a fat guy.  I know what that's like.  But, feeling this freedom of movement with all sorts of endurance...well, it's kinda cool.
