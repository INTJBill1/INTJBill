It just didn't *feel* like the moment; I didn't *feel* like I'm there yet.  I want to blow the doors off the folks who haven't seen me in years.  And I'm afraid if I participate in community now, I'll be distracted from my drive.  I haven't ruled out following social media in a broad sense, but not in any sort of participatory way.  Places like Facebook require a lot of resources for me to maintain.  As for now, I'll be investing that time into hitting my marks for 2021.  I've got them all laid out under [my New Year's Resolution list](/resolutions/).

Already, I came out of the gates strong on the first day of the new year.  I woke up in my 3-something hour and began my Python class.  At 5, I did my lifting routine followed by my striking regimen as detailed on my [Fit](/fit/) page.  I feel absolutely awesome in my new Sanabul compression shirt and tights.

Who knew a carnivore diet would place my mind in such a strong frame of reference of my world?
