You might have read yesterday's post about my reliance on a static website. It was articulate…made some solid points about a WP mismatch for me, right? Yet, nevertheless, this site looks very much like a WordPress install. What gives, Bill?

The sole reason for the site's existence is to encourage my fitness endeavors. My personal websites haven't always functioned in that capacity—even before I owned my own domain in 2002, there was journaling through prose and abstraction by poetry. And when I included the recovered files of those old words into today's website, I gotta admit, I always felt…open and unguarded by sharing those things. Sure, on one level, I haven't changed for I remain me, but those old posts and poetry feature a less evolved me. Like the Counting Crows lyric goes, "And the price of a memory is the memory of the sorrow it brings," it's hard to take a look back and know everything thereafter. Being a linear entity is a gift.


So, I make a break from my Jekyll & markdown implementation on GitHub Pages to a WordPress install on NearlyFreeSpeech. One aspect that I *do* like that no one else cares to be aware is that this is completely my space. I'm not just bumming somebody's sofa as I couchsurf across the web. And honestly, it's cheap to host websites like these. For domain renewal, privacy and hosting, I spend about $2/month for a fully-hosted site. For the entire year:

* 2020: under $21 (hosted with GitHub for Oct-Dec)
* 2019: under $25
* 2018: under $45 (had a 2nd domain)
* 2017: under $25

The bulk of the expense is the domain renewal &amp; privacy charges totaling $13.83.

Anyway, my point is that this can be a cost-effective tool for me to reinforce behavior while applying present and future dynamic solutions contributing to….BLUCK, what am I, a corporate prospectus? Dude, this site let's me throw up TWO fists and rock it.
