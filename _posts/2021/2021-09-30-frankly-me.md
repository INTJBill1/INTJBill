Not so fast: I *just* might stick with Idagio for I am really LOVING it!  The biggest drawback of its usage is...frankly, ME!  I just don't know *what* to like...YET.  Sure, in my strengths, I can invoke *Freebird*, *Mayonnaise*, *Everlong* and *America*.  However, in this context, all I got is *Clare De Lune*?  *Nessun Dorma*? Beethoven's 5th? Is *Time to Say Goodbye* a thing? I get a sense that a singles schema does not apply the same in this genre—if I may paint it with broad strokes.

I gotta admit, I am a sucker for Idagio's clean interface.  And they do curate a LOT of content.  Then there's new albums broken down by orchestral; concerto; chamber, solo instrumental, choral and song, and opera.

Further on its *Discover* tab, there's this sampling of titles from its *Playists for You*:

* Postcard from Florence
* Transatlantica!
* Postcard from Rome
* Forest Murmurs

Furthermore, look at this write-up for Forest Murmurs:

>  Most of us are drawn to the beauties and mysteries of the forest, but composers have an ulterior motive: the tantalizing prospect of capturing those things in sound. From Purcell and Geminiani to Hans Abrahamsen and Robert Patterson, they have done just that.
>
> This playlist takes its name from one of the most fresh and radiant moments in Wagner's 'Ring' Cycle. It takes in the darkness of the primeval wood, including the heaving winds, creaking trees and mystery critters of Sibelius's ghoulish 'Tapiola'. But courtesy of symphonies, operas and instrumental works, from huge orchestras to a single guitar, we are reminded that the forest is not just a place of wonder. It is a place of refuge, of joy and of intense creativity. And potentially one of transformation too.

Indeed, this is uplifting and brings me closer to the person I want to become.  

And its Moods tab with a spin dial just makes sense:

* Happy
* Joyful
* Radiant
* Festive
* Passionate
* Excited
* Nervous
* Angry
* Tragic
* Sad
* Melancholic
* Peaceful
* Relaxed
* Gentle

While I flirted with the prospect of returning to a general music stream service to hack through weeds of ideology, step over tribute band knockoffs and avert case studies in the doctrine of total depravity, it came to me, "why pay for such misery?" Chiefly, does this—or anything else, aid me in becoming whom I envision to be?  Or, am I just playing patty-cakes?
