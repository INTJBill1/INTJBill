I'm frustrated...OK, I might even be down. I mean, I'm NOT knocking the dust off my *All-Time Favorite I'm Depressed Album*, R.E.M.'s 1992 *Automatic for the People*, but nevertheless my humanity is showing.

After bracing my heel overnight two days ago, the sharp pain dashed to the front of my foot, more specifically, to the right of my left ankle. For whatever reason, English never came up with a layman's word for this spot—at least not in the manner I've wielded the lexicon. It's just more painful inflammation that keeps me sidelined as each step is a stinging shot of pain leaving me FAR off pace with FitBit. To put it into perspective, my last three days:

* Saturday: 1,415
* Sunday: 2,193
* Monday: 1,295

...and this is in the context where the first week of 2021, I average 14,500 steps/day, a number I was improving to reach my previous 20,000 average.

I can't move and didn't intend to prophesize before my injuries in naming this Expedition: *The 18th: Moving in Stereo*—it's become the only kind of moving I'm doing! With this lack of movement and daily inflammation that hampers weightloss, I don't expect any sort of fanfare on Thursday's weigh-in. In fact, instead of eye-popping numbers, the best will come of it will be that I haven't gained weight!

Not that workouts lead to weightloss, of course, as I'm reminded of all the intensive workout sessions of The 16th Expedition: 20⚡25 that would have been just a three lb loss if I hadn't shifted to my carnivore diet with nine days lefts to lose four lbs more. Clearly, however, there is a positive relationship to workouts and fitness. For the time being, I'm idling on the couch with a tank full of motivation.
