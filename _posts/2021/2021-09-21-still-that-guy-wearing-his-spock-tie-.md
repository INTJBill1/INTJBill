...and I make my return to Spotify.  Yes, in yesterday's post, I brought up my tension with the platform—that hasn't changed, yet I recognize how music compels me forward.  Sadly, my Expeditionary playlists cannot be recovered (and I don't know if approximated will be sufficient), but I can begin anew with The 24th kickoff on Thursday!

One of the compelling factors in this adoption are my discovery of additional Spotify clients.  While tonight I gave [Spot](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2021/02/spot-gtk-spotify-client-for-linux) a try, I wanted something even further pared down and went with a CLI version—so very COOL!  It makes me feel like I'm back in 1996, playing a .WAV file for my DOS bootup on my old 486 running at 40 MHz.  It's an app I had to compile from source: [ncspot](https://github.com/hrkfdn/ncspot).  I took a screenshot of a theme I was throwing together for it:

It's got all the zip of an FTL drive AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, there's NO GUNK taking up my  screen's real estate!  I cannot highlight that enough!  The Internet for as long as I can remember has been like a poorly managed town regarding land zoning and signage.  That was the big draw of early Google—clean...minimal.  I still like that—I've never changed.

Some sort of change will be coming down the line regarding the theming of this site.  I'd like to revisit synthwave/retrowave.  Earlier, I reworked the JavaScript for the countdowns to get rid of the months, though visually the countdowns remain spartan.
