Since New Year's Day, in these past five days, I've been hammering out workouts at 4 AM.  It hasn't been in the gym, but at my keyboard as I learn how to code in Python.  I'll problem solve for an hour, then will either hit the weights and the bag or glide into cardio, returning later in the day to complete my daily targets.  My coding morning provides some zings of delight (*eventually*) while it works my mind over as I later do the same to my body.  I haven't seriously touched coding since the '90sâ€”HTML/CSS markeup doesn't count!  

Coding brings back memories and I half expect to print my daily programs to a dot matrix printer after I complete them.  In one instance, I spent a lot of time on the computers in a lab that did NOT have a *SINGLE* hard drive between them!  By 1994, the Tandy 1000s we were using in high school were a decade old.  And they were a year older my senior year, as they coasted along at 4.77 MHz.

In '96, I can't say my first semester in college was much better as I had to log into a VAX terminal to check my email, this being in the context when I had email at home via an Eudora mail client on Windows 95.  Yes, my password on the system had to be six characters, no more, no less.  My password?  PICARD.

Yeah, times have definitely changed since those days.  Even this morning, one of my assignments was to develop a random password generator, complete with letters, numbers, and symbols.
