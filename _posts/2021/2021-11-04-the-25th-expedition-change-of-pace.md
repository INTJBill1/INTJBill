With today's 182 lb (-4.5%) weigh-in, The 25th Expedition is now here and with it, the insertion of a change of pace!  More of that in the coming days....

Last Sunday's The 500th Night Diet 5K foreshadowed today.  That race ushered in a new era.  Which, is an old era.  Which is new.

With it, I brought back my earlier theme to promote clarity and improve my focus.  In doing so, I....

* Implemented a line-by-line stylesheet migration;
* Revamped the Weigh-in table;
* Slightly changed the style of the Resolutions table and updated the Python objective;
* Moved *Races* to *Status*;
* Moved my *Log*s and *Poetry* to *Me*;
* Updated Weigh-in line chart for today;
* Reset the countdown clock for the next weighin.

Last night, I played around with bash scripts and Desktop launchers to make my life easier.  Employing sshpass, I have a script that logs into my web host making it a single double-click and I'm in.  I would have daisy chained that with another script I created last night to make a seamless experience, but I guess that's not possible—at least not with my current skill set!  That second script:

* Pulls two .htaccess files and *Let's Encrypt* directory since every time I rebuild my Jekyll site, the process removes them;
* Builds the site with my new update(s);
* Moves the .htaccess files and directory back in place.

Sure, I could type all of that into a terminal by hand for that's exactly what I've been doing up to now, but I'd rather just type ./build.sh—I know, not the most creative name, but I was spent cognitively!

Finally, I threw together a script that kicks off my local Jekyll site from the Desktop because...well, I want to be lazy.

I spoke with the Spotify Bot last night and have deleted my account.  In the past, I traveled from Expedition to Expedition through music and while I even had a playlist set aside in commemoration of The 24th, I'm doing something different.  And honestly, when I tore down all of the old playlists from recovery, it set the tone for the future.

Spotify is a service that has been up for the debate, but ultimately it has failed to meet expectations. Customization is friggin' easy to do across the virtual cityscape!  Even Burger King had *have it your way* [Whoppers back in '74](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJXzkUH72cY).  As I get older, it just seems more and more like a die cut world.
