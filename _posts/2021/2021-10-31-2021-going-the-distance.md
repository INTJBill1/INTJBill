The 2021 WOLVERINE Cup Series kicked off this morning at the University of Memphis with the The 500th Night Diet 5K.  It was an absolutely GORGEOUS day with a sunny, 48&deg; F start.

I had some trepidation entering the race as my body was in a detrained contextâ€”I had a fear that I'd stop running: it's like an anxiety that runs over me that I would give up and quit.  I've always been that way, even when I was 16.   Thus, with a Rocky-themed playlist along for the ride, I declared that the one thing I REFUSED to do was quit.  And once I hit the corner of Goodman and Spottswood, I began my roadwork toward the University:

The biggest challenge of the race came right at the beginning with four-flights of stairs to hit the pedestrian bridge  followed by the descent.  Most of the race thereafter was running through my memories, seeing all the faces that have moved on, building up to a swing around Patterson as I smiled toward those in MA and study abroad programs.  Of course, at whatever I weigh right now and this nearly 200-day beard, I'm hardly recognizable to those 2009 & 2011-2012 folks.   Now, for those from 1996-2001 or still others from 2003-2006, there are some similarities.

Today, I did not stop.  I kept enough in the tank to release my best pace in the last leg to close things out.  My time, 56:37, is merely a benchmark for me to beat in the next race.  Back in 1998, I thought my 3-mile time in 29 minutes was atrocious.  But, I know what I've accomplished to get to this point, so I won't be hard on myself.  But, that time OUGHT to be the worst of the 2021 season!  For this week, it's the best time of this year!  

The next competition is a week from now:  The Ram & the Bear 5K at Ellendale Park on November 7.
