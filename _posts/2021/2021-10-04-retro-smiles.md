Sure, I enjoy the classical genre, but I gotta have my retrowave!  Artists like the aftorementioned [Primo the Alien](https://primothealien.bandcamp.com/) and [the Midnight](https://themidnight.bandcamp.com/) along with [Gunship](https://gunshipmusic.bandcamp.com/album/gunship), [Kalax](https://kalax.bandcamp.com/), [TimeCop1983](https://timecop1983.bandcamp.com/), [Arcade High](https://arcadehigh.bandcamp.com/), [Betamaxx](https://betamaxxmusic.bandcamp.com/), [stuff from New Retro Wave Records](https://newretrowave.bandcamp.com/), [Scandroid](https://scandroid.bandcamp.com/music), [Makeup and Vanity Set](https://makeupandvanityset.bandcamp.com/), [Mitch Murder](https://mitchmurder.bandcamp.com/) and others.  I may be finally adopting Bandcamp as my music platform, especially as I'd rather compensate the artists directly.  In fact, I'm already envisioning shoving over a bundle on November 5th, the next [Bandcamp Friday when 93% of the take goes to the artist.](https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/bandcamp-fridays-2021)


I missed this 2020 remix by Primo the Alien of a Midnight favorite of mine.  I'm delighted to have run across it!  She has been a part of other songs I've liked, such as *My Delorean*, and I'm liking this 2021 release, *Heart On the Run* EP by Primo the Alien.

Weave my nostalgia leanings with my futurist bent and see my attraction toward synthwave.
