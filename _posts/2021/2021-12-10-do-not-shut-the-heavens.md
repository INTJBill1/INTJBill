For the past several years, my site featured a retrowave theme as a nod to the genre that entwines the pattern of the past  with the shape of things to come.  A central symbol of retrowave involves an illustration of  setting sun out on the horizon.  Starting in 2019, I began using it as the favicon for this website while my background always had mimicked the look.

When I first ran Logos in 2017, I thought its Verse of the Day feature was always artfully done.  That said, I turned it off *(I do like to streamline things)*.  It's not something I've seen in years.  

And you can imagine my being taken aback yesterday when I flipped it back on and saw that its verse of the day featured something that was something very familiar.  It *really* does feel like one of those moments where I feel God encouraging me.

I'm on the precipice of rejoining Facebook. I am wary of returning to social media platforms; I don't want to be like...

I **don't want** to be that person who rolls out of bed and immediately grabs his phone to check out Facebook.  I don't want to go backward: the past couple of mornings, the first thing I do is to get into my Bible.  It has been transformative.  Worries of the world tend to shed off. The world is a wreck and I'm at peace.  Following Jesus is a good deal.

I happened to run across a prophecy in the Old Testament pairs ever so delightfully with something I've been running across in my daily study in 1 John:

> And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever.  
>  
> And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.
>
> 1 John 2:17 and Daniel 12:2

John MacArthur makes the following observations in his message, *[Why Christians Don't Love the World](https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/62-16/why-christians-dont-love-the-world)*:

> The world is in the process of disintegrating. We're not just talking about the second law of thermodynamics, the law of entropy, that all matter is breaking down, although that certainly is an element of it...all the human beings who have followed the world's system, all the people in false religion from all of human history, all of the anti-Christ, anti-God people, all those who live their lives within the framework of the world, under the power of Satan. They are all in a death spiral and they are catapulting at a rapid rate into eternal hell...  
>  
> Are you surprised that things are as bad as they are? You say, "Things have never been this bad in my life." Well, that's right, they've never been this bad in anybody's life because they're getting worse and worse and worse. We can assume they're going to be worse in the next generation and worse in the generation after that and the generation after that until Jesus comes. Sin is destroying the system it thrives on. It's like cancer, it's eating itself.

John MacArthur preached that in a sermon on Oct 27, 2002. 

How I *long* for the future when all of the corruption will pass away! As for me, I'll keep dancing in the meantime:
