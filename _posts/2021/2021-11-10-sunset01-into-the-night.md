I'm stoked at the outset of this adventure I'm upon.  I've got my bags bursting at the seams with provisions.  I don't know what lies ahead, but it will be good.  It's not unlike those times I got off planes, rode trains across Europe and ferries across channels, my whereabouts unknown to others with my wits as a companion.

They can keep their "safety" 'cause what they call safety looks awfully like subjugation to us.
