It was another 3-something in the morning.  I *really* ought to pencil it in earlier to 2:30 AM as I'm planning on *kneading* that time for bread‚Äînot for me.

Continuing on the theme of yesterday, last night, I worked on my project management approach and I think I've got it hammered down.  You'll recall that I prefer projects to be about assigning things to identities rather than bland *what's*.  It's a bit more organic and if I see it as a person, it leads to a fuller project.  In the past, the schema was more of a title thing like *Fitness Guru.*  

I dinged to the next level.

In RPG games like *Dungeons & Dragons* and *World of Warcraft*, it is typical to run a 5-man party for a dungeon run.  In the case of WoW, there is the tank that generates aggro so that the monsters focus on him while there is a healer whose primary responsibilities lie on healing the tank.  The other three characters are damage classes that are there to advance the group by neutralizing the threat.  When people carry out their roles within the party, success occurs over and over again.  When people fail to recognize and perform their role, generally it leads to a party wipe.

I burrowed through all of my projects and whittled them to be achieved by five characters.  Initially, I considered having more by making a village, but thought remembering who did what was beyond the Todoist platform.  I called up two of my own characters and three from movie franchises:

**The Tank: üõ°Ô∏è Makyah, Orc hunter**

Last adventuring in 2015, Makyah returns as the most successful character in World of Warcraft with an impressive menagerie of exotic and spirit beasts to choose among to fight at his side as the situation calls for it.  While it is virtually unheard of for a hunter to tank for a party in all but the most dire of circumstances, this party prioritizes agility with an emphasis on maximal damage output.  Makyah's diverse responsibilities span supporting daily upkeep, checking the coin purse, hammering out builds, upgrading the castle, tending to the adjacent garden, and maintaining the stable.

**DPS I: ‚öîÔ∏è Legolas, Elven paladin**

Stepping into this world from *The Lord of the Rings* and *The Hobbit* trilogies, Legolas is known for his unmatched archery proficiency, graceful close combat, agility, and adaptability, making him a formidable and versatile warrior.  In this instance as a paladin, he trains mind, body, and spirit for the fight.

**DPS II: ‚öîÔ∏è Thundercast, Tauren druid**

The venerable Thundercast's journey began many years ago in 2000 in the world of *Evercrast*, where he first appeared as a Halfling druid amidst the *Ruins of Kunark*. Later on, he was reborn as a Night Elf druid in Teldrassil in the *World of Warcraft*.  Disenchanted by the Alliance's extravagances, he made a life-altering sacrifice, becoming a Tauren in devotion to the Horde. Thundercast now offers his wisdom and instruction.

**DPS III: ‚öîÔ∏è Tony Stark, Human bard**

Tony Stark's departure from the Marvel multiverse into the role of a bard is a captivating transition, where his charisma, ingenuity, and quick wit not only captivate his newfound companions but also serve to mitigate threats, and his technological acumen proves invaluable, even in a realm where conventional flight is not feasible.

**Healer: ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π Tauriel, Elven cleric**

Also hailing from Tolkien's trilogies, Tauriel gracefully leaped from the shimmering portal into the fellowship, offering more than just her role as a battlefield medic; she brings formidable damage-dealing prowess to support fatigued warriors, stepping in to mend Makyah when needed.
