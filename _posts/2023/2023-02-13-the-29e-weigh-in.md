After 42 days, *The 29th Expedition: Erebor* has docked into port.  Its results:

<p style="font-size:2rem;text-align:center;font-weight:bold;">13 lbs / -5%</p>

*[(Overall Graph)](/builds/the-high-fat-carnivore-build/#the-overall-map)*

That now adds to **a total loss of 43.5 lbs** in 12 weeks, outpacing the magnificent keto initiative of Expeditions 13 and 14 of 36.25 lbs.  That said, The 14th lost 12 lbs—basically the SAME as The 29th. 

Back then, I stumbled into the answer without knowing it!  I was averaging 212 grams of fat back then in a keto context.  Unfortunately, I still believed in having my protein jacked-up high, so it averaged 128 grams as opposed to today's 75.  That higher amount would prove to come back and bite me.

Waving that all aside, how did I lose this 5%?  This was the total served in the ship's galley for the voyage of cooked totals:

* **Ground Beef**: 12.2 lbs
* **Bacon**: 9.5 lbs
* **Bacon fat**: 4.5 cups
* **Butter**: 10.1 lbs
* **Ghee**: 3.7 lbs - *homemade from 5.4 lbs of butter*
* **Coffee**: 10.4 gallons
* **Lamb**: 1.5 lbs

What did that look like?   While averaging 1.7 sticks of butter, it evolved into adding hitting 4.3 oz of ghee in my 3-cup coffee at 3-something in the morning.

For lunch-ish?  A half-package of bacon and 1-2 tablespoons bacon oil poured atop a 1/2 lb burger that cooked down to 5+ oz—sometimes I skipped the bacon fat (hey, sometimes I share).  After 10:30 AM, I'm good for the rest of that calendar date.  Sometimes, I'll make another cup of coffee to pick up any ghee stragglers (0.3 oz at most) around 2-3 PM, but mainly, it is just water.

Pretty simple, right?  I feel like I'm overeating because I've forgotten what those diet hunger pangs felt like.  This approach runs around 2000-2100 calories (if that EVER mattered). 

When I look back and remember how ravenous I was to eat my next morning "meal" of crackers—dehydrated spinach, broccoli and flaxseed—I just shake my head.  That 1240 kcal ceiling was just *dumb*.  "Look at me, I'm semi-starving.  My body will NEVER react adversely to this with a wild roller coaster ride back up!  Weee—who needs sustainability?!"  

...hey, I had to *learn* that I had to eat BACON to lose weight!  

[Gaffigan got it (mostly) right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqFi0cZ4p1E).

No, forever shall it be said that SUGAR is the killer in the room.  And it's added to virtually every product—AHA approved!  Yep, the American Heart Association recommends 60% of your diet to be sugar.  Do we even need 1% of THAT?  

...but...*need vs. want*...it is an entirely different beast.  You just don't get to 336 lbs by not WANTING 4 or 5 donuts, a buffet table of Taco Bell, a 1/4 gallon of Blue Bell Ice Cream and to wash it all down with 2 liters of Coca-Cola for the night. I'm not exaggerating there. 

Perhaps, my eating foods sourced from, or pretty darn close to, animals isn't a bad thing...

And hey, I have my vice!  I'm *pretty* sure there's not a coffee cougar lurking in the jungles of Central America.  Actually, I TOTALLY get that caffeine is a natural pesticide AND a psychoactive drug!  That said, look, I have NO problem of being the [Billy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIb5fGRBHxA) at the head of the mind flayer army comprised of Hawkins residents gutturally choking down chlorine and rat poison to take over ~~the world~~ a small, Indiana town.

But, SUGAR...I'm totally convinced [THIS is Sugar's theme song](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=tqQGWhge5yo&feature=share).
