I never know if I ought to schematically approach Sunday as part of the weekend or the kickoff to a new week.  It is a pivot point, isn't it?  And thus, does my fat fast correct the excesses of the last week or does it shape my outlook for the upcoming week?  These aren't mutually exclusive, I suppose.  

Whether coming or going I do not know, but Sunday is a doorway.  And if I may steal from Semisonic, Sunday is the "time for you to go out to the places you will be from."

I am entering the sixth week of my resistance regimen;  I have left the sixth week of my cardio gym.  I don't have my workout template to share; I don't know what it's going to look like.  I know there won't be days when I have to cut the last couple of sets because of time.  I do visualize the ROI on that set of NordicTrack adjustable dumbbells and that incline bench... 

I am doing something new by invoking what I led off in April 2018.  I will not be wilting at age 45 from the noonday sun.  No, I am death:

> We’re all scared. You hid in that ditch because you think there’s still hope. But Blithe, the only hope you have is to accept the fact that you’re already dead. And the sooner you accept that, the sooner you’ll be able to function

I ran across a fun playlist on YouTube Music: [College Radio Memories](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=RDCLAK5uy_kOp_Jn5cqp0lkCY6jQ2xRxekyGT_txl6Y&feature=share&playnext=1).  For me, it hearkens back to various eras, but my mind jumped to that time in Arizona around '06 and '07 when I listened to a lot of Cure and Smith's along with Grant-Lee Phillips 80s cover album, [*Nineteeneighties*](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nXBsl5QjY3pTiNBxRU4FMeLEjzEOtKxMQ&feature=share), which tied new wave into my interests at that time with Springsteen's albums *Nebraska* and *The Ghost of Tom Joad*, unique to that corner of my life in the Sedona sunset.
