Does this site look a bit familiar?  

Yes, I brought back the THEME.  I made a Wordpress child for the Make template; I skinned it atop GeneratePress for WP; I toyed with an implementation of it for my static stuff.  My theme was the colors of 2018, 2019, and 2020 with a few appearances along the way.  And LOTS of STRANGER THINGS, new wave, and stargazing. 

It's time...it's time to bring it back and *be*.  I *really* did think I was gonna run with that University of Memphis-inspired theme for the 2024 season, but...maybe I left behind that in a snowbank beyond the wall in Seward. 

But, that's not all!  I have finalized my New Year's Resolutions!  There is a lot of change minimally shoved into it this year.  Then there's a LOT of ramp-up.  Then there's the Software Standards have returned with most of the services I've previously sworn off...

While not explicitly featured on the list, DIY projects are gonna make a big impact in 2024.  This past November, I switched out all of the blinds in the house in November.  Now, as part of that teardown of that atrocious built-in workbench in the garage, today I finished resetting that 112" W x 43" work area down to its studs.  I have yet to decide what to do with that space. 

I'm also working on plans for my first build at this house: appropriately enough, a workbench.  Actually, I need to make a few tables as I've got to unbox that table saw, miter saw, drill press...

...and now, a wood planer!  OK, so my material budget for this month was rerouted.  It's something I wanted for a year now and my wife who went up to Harbor Freight for me for a hammer and a pry bar, came back home with [this](https://www.harborfreight.com/power-tools/joiners-planers/15-amp-12-12-in-portable-thickness-planer-63445.html) on sale.

Speaking of that Harbor Freight purchase, [this $8.99 24 oz. hammer](https://www.harborfreight.com/24-oz-fiberglass-framingrip-hammer-68983.html) hits *hard!*  And [this $5 2-piece pry bar set](https://www.harborfreight.com/2-piece-flat-pry-bar-set-67477.html) has totally cracked open my heart.

On Saturday, I bought 3-month subscriptions to both Habitica and Spotify.
