Yes, it is the THIRD anniversary of being clad in chest hair, howling at the moon, and sinking my teeth into flesh!  Well, something like that.  It even feels *organic*, not in the marketing sense, but something that fits naturally to me.

While it is neither the 637 nor 237-day stints, in this current run, I am now past 25 days.  I continue to feel jacked-up on energy which has been helpful as I've been sneaking into 2024's New Year resolutions: the last couple of days, I've been installing window blinds as they've been shipped in from Amazon for a total of 8 with another one tomorrow.  I've got a few rolls of tedium to apply from window film.  

While truck shopping, I kept having this thought rolling around my head: a truck does not create/make productivity; it's just a red Radio Flyer wagon; it's just a box on rollers; it just checks a box as a project req in the logistics of material acquisition for my workbench and everything that slides off it.

I lament giving away that 2016 edition workbench I built!  But where was I gonna put that with the move to Memphis?  And hey, this is an opportunity to build something even better, even if initially it's totally catch-22 stuff, e.g. I can really use a workbench to create a workbench.

I do find joy in laying out and planning the construction of a thing.

The great thing about having my own website down some rural road that forked off another obscure exit ramp on the *information superhighway* is that I can be free. There's no pretense.  There's no push for Ginsu knives or the Super Bass-O-Matic '76 here.  I don't write to get your feathers ruffled so that you follow *MY* to-do list.  Perhaps that's why I dislike today's pop Internet: the lack of authenticity.  

And in the quiet of the morning, if there was one technology I wish I could strip away from human consciousness, it would be the Internet.  Now, regarding intranets, I'm totally on board with that—local LAN stuff—but, it's a pretty logical jump to move from a wide area network to the Internet.  Now, I'd think I'd LOVE the knowledge sharing of the Internet, but there's this common denominator attribute that slides all the way down into the mud.

Maybe I'm bugged by the lack of contribution/participation that everyone flocks to because of...what?  Novelty?  That's what The Cool Kids do?  And all I see is just another IMG tag encased by CSS code with some jazzy Javascript.  How well does the thing hold up written down with an ol' #2?  I daresay that takes a lot of umph outta this *Video Killed the Radio Star* culture.  In 2003, the world was a whole lot of sizzle without steak, and it's no different now in 2023.
