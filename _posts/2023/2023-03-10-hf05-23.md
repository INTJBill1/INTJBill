You'll recall a week ago on trip to Harbor Freight, I picked up a $400 [Hercules tablesaw](https://www.harborfreight.com/10-in-15-amp-compact-jobsite-table-saw-with-rack-and-pinion-fence-57673.html).  At the time, I was pumped as I got 10% offâ€”$40.

Wouldn't you know it a few days later, they had a coupon for that very same tablesaw? $320. And as they honor their coupons retroactively upto 30 days, it was that time again. So, yesterday, off I went to Harbor Freight. 

I saved $40 in addition to that earlier $40! (Not to mention another $8 of sales tax.)

Now, I really wanted and optimistically hoped a ladder would fit in my Toyota Camry, a 17-ft'er that's totally got the spirit of Transformers on a $30 off sale.  But, no dice: their inventory system got it wrong.  I wanted more but...again, I'm confined into the parameters of my impending move with closing but a week away.

So, a little over $25 later with tax, I came out with a bag of goodies:

|#| Item | Discount | Actual<br>Price |
| -- | -- | -- |
|x2| [5 mil Nitrile Powder-Free Gloves, 100 Pack, XL, Light Blue](https://www.harborfreight.com/5-mil-nitrile-powder-free-gloves-100-pack-large-light-blue-68497.html) | $5 | $4.99|

|x1| [CR2025 Lithium Button Cell Batteries, 4-Pack](https://www.harborfreight.com/cr2025-lithium-button-cell-batteries-4-pack-68130.html) | - | $2.99
|x2| [200 Lumen LED Super Bright Flip Light](https://www.harborfreight.com/200-lumen-led-super-bright-flip-light-64723.html) | $1.50 | $1.99 |

Perhaps the purchase that impresses me most is that $2 light switch.  First, it's bright. Like, now-I'm-blind bright.  I wish I had the power was out the other day for hours.  On the back, there's holes to hang on something; there's a command strip; there's even a couple of magnets.  All for $2!  It runs on 4 AAA's which ARE included.  Just a lot of bang for my buck.
