## Song 1 of The 32nd Expedition Music Approach

Since 2021, I thought the following song makes a compelling case for one of the best walking/running songs that people never heard.  And a quick glance at the comment section confirms that...along with 27 million views:

## The Training Approach

I am entering my 4th week of lifting and 5th week of doing cardio at the gym.  These days pass in quick succession.  I suppose that is a benefit of a routine...or it could be a detriment as Taco Bell fills ["night after night after night after night...down in Dry County."](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=90ngqyOpQTw&feature=share)


### Resistance

While I do not feel this is finalized as I continue to experiment, this is my current approach:

1. Curls (biceps)								
2. Hammer Curls	(forearms)									
3. Lying Triceps Extensions	(triceps)	

### Cardio

I continue to follow that by heading up to the gym for 1-2 hours of cardio with a push for an extended cardio session on Saturdays.

I will be integrating an interval workout to gear myself into a running regimen through my Garmin watch.  I am returning to 2021<mark>...and 1995.</mark>

## The Dietary Approach

I am experimenting with something I tried for a day last Expedition: fat fasting every Sunday.  Since Sundays are my rest days (for now), there are no workouts that usher in the influx of protein from my meal of the day.  I have always aligned myself with the idea of metabolic confusion, though I did not know to call it as such.  I have just always recognized that our bodies are awesome at adapting.

This point was reinforced to me as I watched the following video,

## A Macros/Weightloss Summary

The following are the results of my efforts since November and the macros that got me there: 

<div style="overflow-x:auto" markdown="1">

| # | Loss | Fat (g) | Protein (g) |
| --| -- | -- | -- |
| 28th| -30.5 (-10.5%) | 217.1 | 74.8 |
| 29th| -13 (-5.0%) | 200.5 | 76.7 |
| 30th| -11 (-4.4%) | 204.8 | 77.3 |
| 31st| -12.5 (-5.0%)| 220.7 | 79.8 |

</div>

\* - The macros for The 28th Expedition is only a partial listing as only 25 days were recorded.

There are not enough data to even remotely declare conclusively, but I find it curious that The 29th and The 31st lost the same percentage of weight while The 31st ate 7500 more fat calories.  Where is the 2 lb hit?
