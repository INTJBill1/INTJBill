##  The Training Playlist

Sure, this Expedition is not over until Monday, but I am ready to finalize:

[*The 32nd Expedition: On This Day*](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5J6jDzx3kTcVL-aArjygJoWo6YADUeV8&feature=share) playlist 

These songs rode shotgun with me all the way across the mornings.

## More [Lord of the Dance](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kF99jomvG-w-HLMuQjHhFXczeDzy05iRk&feature=share) than Lord of the Rings

I have owned three, deeply meaningful rings in my life: my high school ring, my college ring and my wedding ring.  And Gollum must be dancing about in a cave with 'em!

My theories:

* **High School** - Meh, contextually it had little value.  I made SURE I got it from that one abomination!
* **College** - Flagstaff airport around Christmas 2004 in that offering plate. 
* **Wedding** - I was TOO FAT to keep wearing it!  I kept it in a safe place with my tools.  And, I gave all of my tools away. 

## Unsurreptitious Serendipity

I unexpectedly ran across a $200 windfall.  I wanted to employ efficacy and NOT just throw it frivolously into the air and exclaim, "To infinity...and beyond!" 

I consider one big purchase: an inexpensive, used guitar...or perhaps to add to my cologne lineup as today, my tiny sample of Versace Dylan Blue ran dry.  I am left with the cutest little bottle of Versace Eros, another 0.17 oz of Versace Pour Homme and the old standbys: 

* Chrome
* Cool Water
* Nautica
* that Eternity for Men (that is named appropriately)
* a stash of Addidas 
* that curious Goodfellow sampler packâ€”one of them makes me wanna saunter around to *Shaft's* theme and be Barry White.  

We won't talk about those Cuba or Yacht Man smells (hey, I rolled the dice).

So, instead of fleeting essences, what *did* I purchase?

### Writing

1. **Uni Kuru Toga Roulette** - A mechanical pencil that rotates as I write?  It really does stroke the geek fire in me.  Where were these when I was a kid?
1. **Zebra DelGuard** - A mechanical pencil that eliminates lead breakage? It's for my daughter whose paws are my own!
1. **A Sooez Clipboard** - A simple convenience as I begin breaking my dependency on computers.
1. **Pencil lead**

### Gaming

1. ***D&D Waterdeep Dragon Heist* (hardcover)** -  For an adventure in the fall? Winter?  [It really depends on the raccoons...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcA0WbJt5ek)
1. **3 cheap 4-shelf racks for $22 a pop** - Gotta put all of these tabletop games and an amalgamation of DnD *somewhere*.
1. **A laptop stand** - for the kids who have taken over my gaming laptop and its penchant for redlining.
1. ***Dead of Winter*** - a tabletop game I wanted for years [after watching Wil Wheaton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG-iUxJcoXc).  Just in time for Tabletop Thursday!
