It continues to amuse me that I keep changing the web design of this site and no one can tell.  Yesterday, I changed the \<mark\> tag that features a color similar to a <mark>Sharpie highlighter</mark>, added transparency and an ever slight gradient coming off to mimic a pen.  Before that, I switched out the whites, off-whites and semi-blacks for good ol' #000000 and #ffffff.  

Yep, good 'ol plain black and white.  

I then went back and used HEX transparency to emulate the colors of the prior palette.  This whole setup allows me the option to make to mark a special day with a tint and not change the feel.  Outside of a Google Chart's line that's hardcoded, my entire site is just this:

	--text: #000000b8;
	--light: #0000001a;
	--neutral: #00000033;
	--canvas:  #ffffffe6;
	--accent: #b70d00cc;
	--highlighter: #edfe5fb3;

Life is shades.

I've been trying to get ChatGPT to generate Javascript code for a self-contained embed of fireworks with text with a retrowave gradient sky, but the best I've got was just a perplexing series of overlapping triangles.  Just because, you *know*?  But, our cybernetic overlords still have a little work to do.  

That said, I do find [this Johnny Cash AI cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyfQVZHmArA) of *Barbie Girl*, Spice Girls and more in the sound of *Folsom Prison Blues* to be OUTSTANDING.  The critical thing is to not just emulate the audio but to create something wholly different.  

...and yet, while the following fail that criteria, I do like these simple AI covers of Taylor Swift of [Blinding Lights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sskNVRykR3U) and (the just tad low) [Fast Car](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st8nADlx1Ug).  

Sometimes, I just like human cleverness.  There's an oddball corner of my brain where this mashup plays prominently on the DJ set list:

Has AI been around longer, maybe like since at least October 2009?  This beloved scene totally comes off as an AI creation:

(...and again, there's a place in my head where *that* takes place).

But, AI does not have to be wonky.  It can elicit an *emotional* response!  Years ago, I went through a big Coldplay phase; this Chris Martin seems spot on: [*How to Save a Life*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42p4weKbmD0).  Yeah, there's a place up there with that melody, too.
