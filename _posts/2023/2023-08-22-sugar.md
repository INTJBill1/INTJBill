This entry's title is from a tune that popped in my head this morning as I cleaned out the pool skimmer basket and fired off the filter.  The great thing about being in my backyard looking out toward Yale Rd is that it is at the crossroads of the present and my beloved pastâ€”it is *nostalgic*!

* Existential Questions!
* Flavored Coffee!
