Yesterday at my Neighborhood Walmart Market, I knew my family was jonesing for coffee, so I headed down that dark alley.  And when my eyes fell upon their selection of Black Rifle, including their Tactisquatch Roast, my favorite graphic that also matches my mug, I felt a tinge of desire, too!  But no, "I've worked too hard to call that (roast) my own.  And I've made myself a world, and it's worked so perfectly."

I woke up this morning at 3 AM and once again, lost the ability to walk unassisted.  Bummer.  So much to do and I have got the mobility of an 80-year-old with a cane—well that, or the expectation of a guy hiding a hacky sack beneath his skin above his knee.

That said, I understand why.  It was already semi-injured and the day before we moved, I arranged everything in order of optimal loading into the truck.  The next day, we loaded the truck, unloaded to the garage and then loaded into the house.  So, I carried everything we owned four times in two days.  Well, OK, not EVERYTHING, but if I could have fit that Camry in the truck, I'd have given it a shot!

In consideration of my knee and these way bigger, bathroom mirrors, I am at a good place for a fitness start.  I even took a before picture of that first day of moving in as a reminder of how I once looked.  I will revisit it a year from now to see the change.  I feel in many ways it reflects the changes that will occur at this house.  It has got a *leg up on me*, as its sewer line is getting replaced, a line that goes down, down, down into the earth and seems to head directly for that big ol' tree.  

Fortunately, I pre-knocked down that old mailbox for the fellas.  While I was textbook at my old place, I gave a love tap to the mailbox at first.  As I readjusted, I must of had brake dysphoria 'cause I revved that engine and SLAMMED that mailbox!  Yeah, as those neighborhood girls said with their mouths agape, "I think he hit the mailbox."  And our inspector was right—there IS rot below the grassline.  Its removal saved my sweat equity. 

That now makes TWO mailboxes I have knocked over with a truck now.  At least this time, I was inside the truck.
