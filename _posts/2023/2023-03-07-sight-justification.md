I was inches away from tearing down this website.  OK, that is a bit dramatic.  I mean, if there was an option to cash out with my $9.32 balance, I would have taken it—I dunno, pick up some clamps from Harbor Freight.  Yes, I am coming up on its 6-year anniversary:  *Created: 2017-04-06 05:46:04 UTC*.  For those of you playing at home, that is just after midnight in the Central Time Zone.  I was ready to trip over the plug to the server.

Technically, this site has been up as long as my Mac had its lid up, because I run that local, Jekyll install.  And here is food for thought: are static sites ever running?  I do not expect other text files to do a song and dance. 

I maintain the site solely out of my own amusement.  Its existence seems to play out as a catalyst for me to do stuff.  There is an illusion that it requires a lot of my time—I don't think it does, well, not principally.  Yes, creating content is a time suck.  Make no mistakes about that!  But, how do I use this space?  To flesh out ideas—not for the site—to wave my wand and zap stuff for my own life.  To highlight takeaways for my own life.  This site is wholly self-serving.  It is why I choose "diary" to catalog prior blog posts—that is what they are!  I do not entreat the user to persuasive dialog—I *could* do that:  

1. Eat real food; gnaw on a cow-you think mankind has pulled *Cheez-Its* out of a box for 1000s of years?  
2. "Get dope out your vein and hope in your brain...You wanna get your lesson and wanna be smart in school?  Get rid of the (sugar). Get away from the in crowd. Get'a close to God."

But, even that nostalgic, local commercial application is not particularly persuasive—it is the outline of what *I* am doing!

And now with a segue with what I *want* to do for my life, yesterday, I watched this trailer for the upcoming release, *Cities Skyline II*:
