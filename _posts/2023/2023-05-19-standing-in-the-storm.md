I close out my resistance week with a strong showing.  Unfortunately, yesterday must'a beat me down, 'cause I slept in to 3:33 AM.  Nevertheless, I tore through my 38-minute Arms day, stripping out half of my rest being sets in order to make up time.

I rolled into the gym parking lot a few minutes off my pace and did the following:

* 15 minutes on the Arc Trainer
* 26 minutes of my run/walk program
* 10 minutes with my 1:1 minute spin bike
* 29 minutes on the BRC outdoor loop

I was stoked with that last segment because my walking pace was more than a minute faster than yesterday and beat my best on that course 47 seconds.  As to my overall best in 2023, I was 51 seconds slower than that target, so it is something I am gunning to accomplish next week.

As I do every morning as I refuel, I watched the [Duck Call Room](https://www.youtube.com/@duckcallroom). They were closing with viewers' emails when they read how a woman mention she accomplished her goal: along with dropping 200-somethng lbs in 2 years, she also hit 10,000 steps every day for a year.  I thought to myself, "I could do that step goal.  I just need focus and consistency."  Even yesterday, I was lamenting that I break my Garmin goal streak every week because I shut things down every Sunday.  Once upon a time in 2020, my goal was 20K a day which I hit ALL the time.

And thus, starting back on Tuesday, May 16, I am kicking off a 10K steps a day for a year challenge!  Why backdate it?  I have been doing just that lately:

* Tuesday: 13,145
* Wednesday: 13,685
* Thursday: 14,041
* Today @ 9AM: 10,030

This has been my most successful week in 2023.  Screw 2021, I am coming for you, 1995.  As it is, my Xero Prio's remind me of my old, black, wrestling shoes (and I jogged everywhere in those things, cotton field ruts and all).  And I'm still the same me as I was then.  I take the same amount of medication as I did then (0).  I have that same fire inside of me as then.  The world's gone crazy, but *She Couldn't Change Me*.
