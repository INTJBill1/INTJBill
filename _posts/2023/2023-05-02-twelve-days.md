## Gym Theory

I went back and counted how many session days I have had since joining up with the BRC: 12.  It does not include the days I have double-dipped; those 2nd workouts have been of little merit.

Last night was one of those.  Now, I wanted to add more cardio to my day for I felt like I left a lot out there that morning.  Thus, off I went to jump into the stream with the rush hour traffic world.  

I do not know what it is, but the evening crowd at BRC just comes off as...play?  Maybe it is just me (it probably is), but the energy there, or how I respond to it, is that it is not the same focus, determination or drive.  It feels like all backburner stuff...relegation.  

And there is no free coffee!

Seeing people before 5 AM in the groove makes me feel a part of their tribe, carving out the time because we know it will get away from us if we do not.  Through the use of discipline, we strive (and stride) to reach our goals.  Again, I wish I knew what time the place opens up!  I used to wait in the dark outside locked doors at the YMCA.

Truthfully, even if I knew, I would not be able to make it.  As it is, after 4 AM, time blows by me as I lift.

## Resistance

Today was a *Chest* day.  It was another 5x15 session involving just a DB bench press, flys and an incline bench press.  As I pushed, I had mixed feelings for at one point I exasperated, "You're WEAK!"  Yep, the best personal trainer is the one in your head!  Out of a total of fifteen sets, I could not finish the 15 reps on FIVE of 'em.  My arms were trembling like a puppy!  I would just get it stuck, half-raised.  Now, long-term, I love getting to that placeâ€”muscles are failing, baby...

...however, in the short-term, the competitor part of me says, "Do it!  Push!"

I actually do not know what happened.  I did not up my weights this week.  I had time to recover from Friday's *Arms*.  Yesterday's *Back* was all pull instead of push...unless the eccentric movement, e.g., the controlled elongation got me? 

The other stuff I did yesterday would not have affected it which included switching out a broken light switch; adding some plugin shop lights to my...*\*sigh\** built-in workbench; maintaining the pool; and watering the dirt and spouting grass in the front yard.

## Cardio

I was on a shortened schedule today, but I put in an hour of elliptical without the use of my arms.  I have a daily focus to build my right quad up.  I watched another episode of *The Last Dance* today, which honed in on Dennis Rodman, a player I loved back in the day because of his tenacity and ability to work. I finished up my day to hit the track (OK, for those dreaded stairs) as I cooldowned and worked the kinks out.

## The Carnivore Refuel

I came home and  pulled together some grub. For the first time, I could not finish the morning meal in one sitting:

*(media content yanked to optimize site)*

  Intake today:

  * 12 tbsps of butter
  * 16 oz of coffee
  * 4.8 oz of chicken wings
  * 3.5 oz of bacon 
  * 2 eggs
  * 2 tbsps of bacon fat

  That puts me at 232 grams of fat and 80 grams of protein.

  All right, Wednesday is my *Legs* day and I have got a ladder I want to try out in the session.  Let's get after it!
