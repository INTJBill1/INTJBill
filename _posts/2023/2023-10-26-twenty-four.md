My pool is closed for the season.  I find it exciting—oh, not *now*.  Indeed, the pool area is an exceeding drab thing.  The black cover sucks the vibrancy from the space; the overgrowth of plants imparts an abandoned mood.  

However, my eyes don't see this.  No, I envision next year: what I'll look like and what I'll be doing when that pool is open again around mid-March.  It was on 3/23/23 with a pool temperature of 63° when I swam for the first time at my house.  Perhaps next year, it'll be 3/24/24 to swim at 64°.

I got to thinking: why not make the first New Year Resolution involve carving down to a BMI of 24 in '24?  I've got 108 lbs to lose.  Can I do this?

Fortunately, I've got this in my back pocket, the knowledge of a high-fat carnivore from November to June '23:  

* **Time span**: 30 weeks
* **Daily fat avg.**: 213 g
* **Daily protein avg.**: 77 g
* **Daily carbs avg.**: <1 g
* **Weightloss**:  2.56 lbs / week (0.37 / day)

The 24 BMI target will be achieved on August 15.  At 166 lbs, I'll borrow from that STRANGER THINGS poster that hung in my gym:  "One summer can change everything."

My last post featured my foot setback and the shelving of self.  Things have since changed as on Saturday, I put in 1700 steps followed by Sunday's 4200.  The foot still aches.  There are mornings I gotta boot it up with a percussion massager. That said, "By the Power of Carnivore...*I Have the Power!*"

## What Am I Listening to Today?

I want to bring this site back to its past.  My temperament has always aligned itself with retrowave / synthwave, even before it was a thing.
