## Harbor Freight Trip 04 of 2023: A Light

I followed up Thursday's table saw with a shop light on a stick.

OK, so this wasn't a planned purchase.  This was the result of the power going off at 10:24 AM with no prospect of it returning as the night approached.  I recently threw out a couple of jar candles from Kroger because my system goes whack-a-doodle after inhaling them for a bit...fun stuff like an unnerving, rapid heartbeat with waves of nausea!  Oh, but how I do love candles.  I wonder if I could make them out of bacon fat?  

I haven't owned a flashlight in some time because of that multi-tool phone.  But, as my phone dropped to 1% power, that option was out.

However. I knew I had a fully-charged cordless drill, so I figured I'd get a lamp that could use its battery.

[20V Cordless 280 Lumen Stick Light](https://www.harborfreight.com/20v-cordless-280-lumen-stick-light-tool-only-57145.html) - *$26.99 with a 15% off coupon*

While there, I didn't even plan to get that, I was choosing [this $20 model](https://www.harborfreight.com/20v-cordless-220-lumen-work-light-tool-only-57279.html), but audibled for the superior solution.

I got home and lit up the kitchen like a Christmas tree.  It worked great for all of 15 minutes that it was needed.  The power popped on at 6:09 PM, almost 8 hours after the circuit was broken.  

## Wire Safe? No is Arc. 

And speaking of circuits, I found this elucidating YouTuber, specifically for this video, [*Electrical Wiring Basics*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syaGf_XUMxA) set to 1.25x.  He confirmed what I always kinda guessed, but I don't trust my *Kinda Guesses*.  As an 11 or 12-year-old, I took apart a small color TV to see if I could link the speaker to something larger, when I got shocked and turned the thing to a Smurf-o-vision—it became a blue-and-white set.  My hand was groovin' on its own for awhile.

And then at Grand Canyon Railway, I was a smart guy for unplugging the UPS unit to upgrade its batteries. I had to switch out some bad batteries in the case.  As I was listening to Metallica's 1983 [*The Four Horseman*](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKOhVSERS8&feature=share), a big ol' flash knocked me back and blackened the tip of my thumb.  Yes, I was removing a few, dead batteries, but clearly, some were ready for an 80s *full of gnarly* ROCK SHOW.

(*Normally, I'd link to that 2007 story, but like so much, it's just another blog lost to the Net gnomes of the past.*)

I also watched [BrettleyBuilt](https://www.youtube.com/@brettleybuilt)'s bit on GFCIs, which is something I'll be doing because the new has some ugly outlets in the water-seeping garage.  I'm pretty KISS tour schedule included several of those outlets.

I never liked my *Kinda Guesses* anyway.
