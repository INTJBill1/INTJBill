> Our time is running out  
As the beat of this heart keeps racing  
The thunder before the storm  
And the tick of this clock keeps breaking  
The calm before all explodes  

YouTube Music suggested [this song](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkTCEuQnBs&feature=share) to me during my workout. Upon my first listening, I KNEW I had to put it into this Expedition's playlist!  Unfortunately for the band and their 2010 release (demo on SoundCloud), they were about a decade too late to the scene.  Totally reminds me of that post-grunge sound. 

Yesterday on the dregs of my cuppa endorphins, I wrote about pace and PRs.  While I find value in those things, those things hold greater value at a future date when my weight stops dropping and things are stable.  Honestly, I should beat my PR every week because I have less of a load to carry.  Last week's run days reminded me that I have a 43 lb backpack that I carry in comparison to 2021's run at Overton Park.   And even on that date and with all the fun I had running in the warm grass finishing up my 5K because I took a wrong turn, I was encumbered.  182 is not 163.

And yes, the same schema holds true for steps.  10,000 steps is not a magical place where a Yeti emerges out from a park's clump of trees to give me a high five.  No, that target reflects a consistency.  For many months when my pilot light was out, what did I do daily?  2k and 4k steps.  One day was under 1k—to be fair, it was a good arms day, 'cause I was on crutches.  It actually amuses me that I applaud these sub-20K numbers because 2020 me would have seen them as a failure.  And 2020-2021 me was driving toward marks on the scale not seen since 2005.  These days, I am just mopping up an overencumbrance due to a delight in heavy whipping cream—OK, that HWC was my take on making reboot of *Breaking Bad* out in the country.  

Admittedly in these days, the fire is not the same, [Destination Unknown](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=XfYmlhz3mIk&feature=share) does not run through my head when I tread these steps again.

> It don't matter where it takes me  
Long as I can keep this feeling runnin' through, my soul

I take on this attitude of "Been here before, get this job done."  Sure, right now, I've got a hundro in my pocket, but it does not compare to the 149/154 lb loss I once had.  In time, it will be a place I do not know.  At any rate, it is not about pace or steps, the chief goal is weightloss.  Those other things ought to contribute to that end, but there are times in which they do not.  In January 2019, my step competition drove me to hit 50K steps on the treadmill in a day which put me out of commission until...well, I do not know since that WordPress mishap lost all posts from late 2018 and 2019.  

I have been tempted in these past few days to return to that CMS and may I ever be reminded...

On the flip side, external events do not phase me.  Even the walking dead in 2020 could not hold me down.  I thrived in that environment; I thought everybody was nuts.  I did my 4-6 in the morning, did my lunch cardio followed by laying out to soak in some Sun.  When I returned to Memphis and saw all those masks to fight the undead and put their faith in government treatment, I could only shake my head, "That ain't the *Eye of the Tiger*."  Folks don't even know how masks work or the definition of a vaccine.  I wonder how they live their lives to not even grasp fundamentals? 

I set that aside as a warning tale and watch for things I do not see.  Look at my own journey, I trusted government and medical "experts" and did the whole RDA, low-calorie thing.  I worked through that and incorporated that into keto with a tidy sum going into the coffers of Vitamin Shoppe.  I had a fantastic display of snake oils!  And then...I went back to my roots—quite literally!  

> Walk the roads my forefathers walked  
Climb the trees my forefathers hung from  
Ask those trees for all their wisdom

Why do my legs exist?  They make up most of my body.  Why are these arms built from throwing things? We are the ONLY species built that way.  Why do I thermoregulate the way I do?  All of this reminds me of...

> ...what I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career, skills that make me a nightmare for people like you...I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you.

I went carnivore.
