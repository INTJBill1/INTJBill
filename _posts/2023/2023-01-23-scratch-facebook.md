For all of the luster built up by the promise for 2023 had conceived, I can only say I have been underserved by a mechanical clanking, Dollar Tree imitation construct of the genesis of a better me.  

I barreled out of the gate.  I strove hard.  I downshifted and my once purposely powerful strides became haltingly heavy.  "Toss overboard the excess weight.  Sure, down the road, pick those things up, but right now, you need speed!"  I revised my Destination '23, that New Year's Resolutions list, to just hammer on the essentials.  And yet, I do less, failing to do the core.  Spinning a witty turn to a remark has been my chief goal; instead of championing change in 2023, I invest in nothing.  How I regret adding that afterthought of a software standard of Facebook into Destination '23!  

As I've written before, I joined Facebook to give a human touch.  I am not there...

1. To pound my chest to Twisted Sister's *We're Not Gonna Take It* and quote, "You're all worthless and weak;" 

2. To thump them over the head with "the firepower of this fully armed and operational" Logos Bible library;

3. To pull out my Dad card and say, "Honey, you don't need to be wearing that," or "Now that don't make a lick of sense—you're gonna hurt yourself," or "Now, son, measure twice and cut once."

No, raining down all of that is RIDICULOUS.  

When I came aboard Facebook, I thought I would be a light in the darkness.  I would write a personal note to everyone who accepted my friend request.  I would post trivial things on my own wall and encourage others on theirs!  Join people in feeling alive!

## The Experiment

I did not get much engagement.  Oh, I have never been into the view counts!  Today's fixation on followers is vanity and has all the substance of flatulence.  Maybe they just stare in silence at my posts.  I would like to think I don't spread drab all over white bread.  I ran an experiment today to see what kind of feedback I might elicit.  

My results at 5:47 PM:

I posted a pre-game video I shot of the UofM band, its cheerleaders and even Pouncer as our fight song triumphantly played on in front of the Liberty Bowl. 

*Commentary: I thought this was a big ol' softball over the plate, playing to the crowd.*

> Me in 2021:  "Weightloss is remarkably easy.  Don't eat sugar.  Carbs are sugar."  
> Me in 2023:  "Weightloss is remarkably easy.  Don't eat sugar.  Carbs are sugar.  Watch out for gluconeogenesis."

*Commentary: Weightloss is always on folks' minds.  This was like a free handout.  Stylistically, I usually would turn this into a bit of humor at the end at my own expense.   That said, I didn't expect any engagement here.  Sad.*

*Commentary: And this one was JUST for me. A potential goodbye.  A callback to an earlier post.*

## The Results

No comments on any posts. **Not so much as even a single Like.**  Not one.  

If I ran it longer, in time, my sweet cousin would have come online and tossed me a bone.

## Other Considerations

Of those who accepted my friend request, all of whom received a personal, custom-tailored note, 28% have not replied these past 3 weeks.  And I include that one person from high school who immediately blocked me after accepting and sending a hand-waving emoji.

When people post anything to me, I made sure I address it on some level.  That's the social expectation, is it not?  Or, did I stay too long from Facebook that Dale Carnegie no longer applies?  I experience this on Facebook: I'll take the time to comment on someone's post, something in which they felt warranted merit.  I'll say something light and fun, taking a thoughtful approach to something they shared...it goes unanswered. 

No, I did not return to Facebook to get praise.  At the same time, I didn't come back to be treated like a water-stained sofa at Goodwill!

When I posted how I just lost 30+ lbs, I got what, two exchanges?  When I submitted a before/after featuring my 149 lb loss: I got my most interaction.  4 people.  I didn't select strangers for Facebook; I handpicked everyone.

Now, I did have had some good interactions with a select few.  It was a delightful, rare highlight of January 2023 on that platform.  These exist in Facebook private messages, but if Facebook has SIMPLY got to be more than an email client for me to stomach it.  

## The Conclusion

I have failed to engage my audience.

Facebook has played an outsized role in 2023.  I cannot afford to waste resources any longer—what is the payoff?  For those for whom I've had a meaningful connection, I hope it can survive beyond Zuckerberg's slums.

I'll restore & advance Destination '23 to what it should have been.

And thus Facebook is my first resolution that's canned for the year.  When it comes to Destination '23 and Facebook, the venerated Spock tells us, "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few."
