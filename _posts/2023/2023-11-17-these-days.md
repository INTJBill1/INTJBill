It's now the third day in a row where unmarkably I woke up early and beat my 2:30 AM Garmin wakeup prodding.  This morning as I prepped to teach biology, I was reminded of many years ago when, as a 14-year-old, I studied in the pre-dawn night for my own biology class.  Conforming to those early mornings was far more difficult back then!  Today?  These pre-dawn hours are a fertile field for thought. 

For my geography class, I've got a video to show: [*Noah's Flood and Catastrophic Plate Tectonics (from Pangea to Today)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd5-dHxOQhg).  A long time ago, I recognized that the Earth is not billions and billions of years old, but [is roughly around 6,000](https://answersingenesis.org/age-of-the-earth/how-old-is-the-earth/).  

On a related note: this gave me chuckles this morning at 2:55 AM: 

> Why should a fool have money in his hand to buy wisdom when he has no sense?
>
> Proverbs 17:16, ESV

So, it's another bread day this morning.  I started fashioning it together at 3:15 AM and pulled it out of the oven right at 6.
