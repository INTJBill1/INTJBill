Today was *not* a good day in the gym.  In the end, within that space that at its end, smelled of a Pink Palace Museum of yesteryear, I just did not have it in me to complete my hour on the treadmill and left with 15 minutes remaining.  I pulled my body out of the gym.

Why?  When I woke up this morning on time at 3 AM, I felt nothing out of the ordinary. I went through my morning routine with my butter iced coffee and even caught a couple of episodes of [Ryan George](https://www.youtube.com/c/RyanGeorge) along the way.  I cranked out most of my sets on my Chest day until I ran out of time.  I was in my groove like every morning.  POD's lyrics "Is that all you got?, haha I'll take your best shot" resonated with me as I popped up to drive to the gym.

However, as I drove in the waning moment of the 4 o'clock hour, a weight crashed upon my shoulders.  "Why am I even going up here?  Am I wasting the time to get up here for climate-controlled cardio?"  I see the same blank faces every day.  It was a world I was from replaced by a bizarro something else:

> Sometimes you **don't** wanna go  
Where **nobody** knows your name  
And **nobody's** glad you came  
You wanna be where you can see (ah-ah)  
Our troubles are all the same (ah-ah)  
You **don't** wanna be where **nobody** knows your name
