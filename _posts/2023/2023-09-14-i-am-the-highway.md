The enigmatic label of this post borrows from the title of a Mitch Murder song, one that caught my attention this morning.  Based on my selection of Tangerine Dream - *Love on a Real Train*, [*Traces to Nowhere*](https://open.spotify.com/track/6AMQMSsh0wYQFyUELMR9Vg?si=c2a067edee454d1f) is on repeat.

Nostalgia.  How it aches my heart.  People...places...things...ideas...all of these were once common in my life...a shared experience...they were the air I breathed...they were *there*...so common...have become lines on the yellowing pages of history... 

As I experience the '20s, I am a ghost on the campus of UofM; I haunt the streets of Bartlett.  I am of a time that once was.  A foot in the past and a knee in the present, I fear the future.

For all the vibrancy of life and drama, *The World I Know* is relegated to unnoticed roadside placards as folks throttle down the road to create their multi-volume tomes to be summarized later on metal lost in overgrowth.

Are these hints of what is to come; is *this* what it feels to be old?  Is life *More than a Memory*?

I return to the thematic elements of 2016: the adventure of the future.  In that year, I listened to a stack of Audiomachine, Future World Music, Epic Score, etc.  In the backdrop of these tales, there is a narrative that was among the top songs of that year for me, a selection from 2002 by Audioslave:

*I Am the Highway*.
