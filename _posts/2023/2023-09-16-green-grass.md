The lone howl of the nocturnal train mesmerizes my spirit.  My mind returns to those night drives cutting through the fog while *Patterns* played on.

With the hush of falling leaves  
Casting shivering shadows  
On the houses through the trees

I look at these years falling off the wall...are things all that different from when I was 23 in 2001?  Yeah, a few pages have been added to the history books.  For me, I picked up a bag of stories and got a few knocks on my noggin' for my trouble along the way.  Fundamentally, my heart is the same as it ever was.  

The benefit of running a blog online for so long is that I can return to both *what* I wrote and *how* I wrote it.  Poetry aside, while I only have a single post from when I was 23, I posted [*Fantasy of Personality*](/diary/2002-09-09-fantasy-of-personality/
) later that year in September 2002.  And yes, it amuses me that I randomly picked out a post that actually has a perspective on today's topic.

I'm still me.

That post was 21 years ago in a September.  What of that September some 21 years from now?  You can bet your bottom dollar I'll be the same in 2044.  At 66, I will still piddle around with tech and complain of its evolution for the worse.  The world was a better place back when we had to boot our operating system off a 5.25" floppy.

I'm giving the "AI" DJ of Spotify a shot.  I seriously doubt the ChatGPT engine is involved; it is likely just a repackaging of the same algorithm from a decade ago stitched together with audio generation for the DJ.  

Spotify specifically references that it will "push (my) boundaries."  Was *that* a feature I was asking for?  I'm just here to have a good time!  Generally, pushing boundaries is a BAD thing, right?  ...unless you are a global superpower and then it's that "Get busy living, or get busy dying" historical debate.  I seriously have my doubts as to whether Spotify will introduce music that I've missed for awhile like Paul Young's *Everytime You Go Away* or entire genres like Southern Gothic.  

So far, it's playing it safe...

* Bon Jovi - *I'll Be There For You*
* Journey - *Faithfully*

I had no interest in its Warrant selection, so it picked out...

> But all of this glitter is getting dark  
There's concrete growin' in the city park  
I don't know who my neighbors are  
There's bars on the corners and bars on my heart  

Well played, Spotify.  Well played.
