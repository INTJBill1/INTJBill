*The 28th Expedition: Ready Player One* has arrived safely into the harbor.  I have lost 30.5 lbs (-10.5%).  To put it into context, it is the most I've lost in a keto/carnivore diet in an Expedition.   Yes, I've dropped more in my first approach, but who CAN'T lose weight in a semi-starved state?  That said, I wanted to beat out The 13th Expedition's 8.3%...and I did.  

Next up? *The 29th Expedition: Erebor*.  I want something greater than 6% as I had a couple of Expeditions at that percentage ([The Expeditionary Manifest](/destination/the-expeditions/)); it would set it as a 16 lb target.  And I just might expect that throughout the 200s, but who's to say?  I just tried to hover above the 75 grams mark on protein and eat in excess of 200 grams of fat. 

For the first seventeen days of The 28th, I didn't monitor my protein intake.  I suspect not paying attention to it explains my wonky numbers in years past.  I just ate *all* the meats back then.  And between the excess protein conversion to sugar and that Devil's cream...well, look, I think sometimes, my weight gain is like this:

> **Dwight Schrute**: Through concentration, I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will.  
**Pam Beesly**: Why would you want to raise your cholesterol?    
**Dwight Schrute**: So I can lower it.  

It's around lunchtime as I write this.  Normally, I would post that sort of thing first thing on this site.  But, one of the drawbacks to sending content over to Facebook is that I neglect this site!  

And I had my doubts about posting my success on Facebook.  People *want* you to spear salads, choke on spinach and fight endlessly against appetite.  There's just an expectation of being miserable when losing weight.  There's a character/morality thing attached to it.  People don't want to know that I've lost 30 lbs by eating half-a-package of bacon per day for 17 days, then thirty days of 5-7 oz of pork belly.  That doesn't show superhuman power of the will!

And I think maybe that they bought into the carb world, that an appetite just can't be quenched.  We've all had our Lay's; we've never shared the Sharing Size Snickers.  But, it's not appetite's fault;  it's carbs.  Carbs just fail to satisfy.  On the flip side, air fry up 3 oz of ribeye fat, and that'll do. No mas!
