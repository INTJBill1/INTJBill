## A LOT of Work Over a Beverage

I do not think I will be doing a day-by-day coffee detoxification status.  OK, OK, since you asked...every time I just got a hint that the aches were coming, I popped a couple of ibuprofen back.  I had SIX yesterday!  That's INSANE for me!  And as someone who only eats once a day, I'd chase it with a tablespoon of fat.  "Git 'er done!"  

I feel the ache begin to creep into my legs and onto my back, but I will attempt to not mitigate the pain before it arises.  It could be just saying, "Top of the morning to ya!"  And this morning began early: on my own, I woke up at 2:30 AM.  I stretched, warmed up my muscles and centered my thoughts.  By the time my 3:30 AM watch alarm went off, it might as well have been 10 AM.

Yesterday, I failed MISERABLY with new techniques for ghee:  melted it over the stove to pour over ice as opposed to my typical hot water Vitamix with ghee at room temperate.  It was the equivalent of candle shavings—Mmm...Southern Candle.  I switched over to Kerrygold butter and was able to easily hit my 200-fat-gram mark.

## The Move Setup

Our move-in date may or may not have been moved up by a day.  Oh, technicalities!  Utilities are set to be switched over, the Internet connection is ready to go live, the truck has been reserved—the list continues.  I am more interested in how this shift will enhance my life, to further my development.  I all but dismissed my *Destination '23*, my list of New Year's Resolutions.  Sure, I maintained some, but dismissed most.  A move here, a move there—everything got disjointed.  But with my rollout of an updated website theme, I am bringing it back.  

In the absence of coffee, my mind seems more focused...more clear.  I do not have this avalanche of ideas crash into me or feel the need to spin plates.
