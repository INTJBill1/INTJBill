Today is a throwback to winter '22.  I have got an OST from *The Hobbit* trilogy pulled up.

Once again, I compose on [FocusWriter](https://gottcode.org/focuswriter/) on my Chinese techno-nationalist box.  OK, my Lenovo does not sound *that* threatening—it has a CUTE name!  Oh, those crafty commies!  Ironically, when we think of computer desktop platforms, if I ask who has the largest market share worldwide, I bet Lenovo does *not* come to mind—probably Apple, right, because of all of the competing IBM clones?   Yeah, I am using old school language here!

I heartily return to that era because of what it represented.  I remember what were in posts like December 24's [*Grandma Got Runover by a (Pork Belly*)](/diary/2022-12-24-grandma-got-runover/).  It was from a week without a shower, a time of my quotation:   "I can't sleep in my bed because I would literally die in there."  I need that as a reminder as I consider the posts that immediately follow.  I need reminders like this from New Year's Eve:

> I'm really proud of my Destination '23, my take on the New Year Resolutions. It took DAYS to create, not for the design or the words, but for its ideas and implementation.
I choose...
>  
> ...to activate things that worked well in 2020;  
> ...to achieve things I failed to do in 2021;  
> ...and to do what I should have done in 2022.  

It is what I really love about the end of the year:  we examine what lies ahead and dream of possibilities.  These things do not come so readily in the upcoming summer months.  I need it further for I have been on a bit of an emotional rollercoaster—inasmuch an INTJ can roll on one of those.  Though I hit my protein marks, after 7:30 PM (once again), I just overate to a tally of 94 grams in excess!  I heading back to pick up that fat fast that I failed on Sunday to attain for a bit of a metabolic confusion correction.

When eating becomes an activity, problems arise.  I also suspect that as this is wing-based eating, that I am not satisfied like how I am with beef.  My Neandertal Valley ancestors brought down mastodons and tyrannosaurus rexes.  They didn't settle for a *chicken*!  

And yet, there may be something I need to address emotionally; I must be failing to accomplish something.  That's the driver of the INTJ, right?  Yeah...

* I left the haunted BRC.  
* I unfastened my Garmin and set it on the table.  
* I have slept in on the last two 3-something AMs and have to reschedule my workouts

These are not the primary issues, but they seem to be symptomatic of it!  Instead of focusing on how I'm gonna paint the walls on this website, I ought to focus on my sight picture.  And thus, I am gonna bring back *Destination '23* and how to effectively augment its capability of fruition.
