That may be my longest diary title since these:

1. *"We Fall from the Choco-Cloud into the Chocolate Lagoon" Shelving the Entropy and Atrophy Trophy* 
2. *A Sunset, the Speedboat, a Cascade of Ocean Mist, and The Dolphin's Cry: I Wanna Change My Clothes, My Hair, My Face!*

For the past several days, I have been on crutches.  From NO recent injury, my right foot has swollen to the point of pain and I cannot put weight on it.  Last night, my crutches got tripped up by a turn on the carpet. When I slammed on my right foot to recover, I shrieked in pain and crashed backward onto the floor.

It's times like these that lead me to change.  Was it long ago I had those 4 AM lifting sessions followed by the 5 AM cardio at BRC?  Where I am now and where I was before—well, what immediately comes to mind comes from a band I first listened to at 15.  Thus, Blackhawk provides some insight of this linear application: 

...from [*I Can Sure Smell the Rain*](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=MFiazwOrgrQ&si=27h_qJHfuBAQCewV)...

...to [*Every Once in a While*](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=fP4QxSP3kpY&si=NHhhgsm__GQxjDBu)...

...with a resolution of [*That's Just About Right*](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=_DEFJHoIazo&si=SrWBqidCNgJQm6-n):

It's always movin' so I let it come through"  
"And that", I say, "is the glory of true independence"   
"Just do what you do what you just gotta do"

> Your blue might be gray, your less might be more  
Your window to the world might be your own front door  
Your shiniest day might come in the middle of the night  
That's just about right  

This personification of a music catalog in the stead of my fitness relationship provides a colorful, spatial space.  It's apt—we've been together since April 2018 with all the compulsory ups and downs... 

 **...I'm in love with Fitness.**

With a clean-shaven face that demands an Adventurer's beard, a Carnivore's hunger, and a Dreamer's crutches, I now repeat what I once said in 2018, "I leave the freezing of fears and the felicity of foods and head out to the les mauvaises terres à traverser tonight."
