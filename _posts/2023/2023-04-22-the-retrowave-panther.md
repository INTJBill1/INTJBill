## Saturday's Fitness Training

I have a solid, overall training regimen in place.  An embed of the Google Calendar is on the Fitness page with a decent responsive styling.  Honestly, Google really ought to provide something other than iframes for its rendering, but one gets the sense that they quit the development of the product a decade ago.

At any rate, I crammed a lot of good things into today!

### Project Planning (4-6am) 

I mapped out where I am going, something I will be planning every Saturday as I review my progress.  It is beneficial to do this weekly.

### Yoga & Meditate (7-8am) 

I did not do too much yoga.  In my first rep of a Sun Salutation, my patella said, "No you're not."  I brought in my old gamma waves into my meditation session via my Bluetooth sleep mask.

### VR (8-8:45am) 

I played a new game, *Gods of Gravity*:

I followed it up with the party mode of *Beat Saber* so that I could face off with my high scores for five songs, including the first one I did in that mode back in early December: The Weeknd's *Save Your Tears*.  Yep, beat my personal best.  I am lighter; I am faster.

### Stationary Bike at the Gym (9-10am) 

I had my second biking session since joining the gym.  For now, I like to maintain a cadence of 65 and adust levels/resistance accordingly.  Eventually, I will punch that up in the upcoming weeks when my right quad finally comes to the party.  It is the first I recorded with the equipment's app:

Hey, and I did not spill my complimentary coffee again on that cooldown walk!

### Fuel Up (11:15 AM) 

I drink 12 tbsps of butter in my iced coffee before heading up to the gym each day.  Now for today, what I whipped up after my gym time was fantastic!  I cooked a whisked egg on a small pan in a tablespoon of bacon fat until it was leaning toward being brown.  My intent was that it could be a taco shell.  I then did another.  I cooked my standard half package of bacon and...whala: 2 bacon tacos.  I omitted the ground beef because I emotionally ate some prosciutto last night and wanted to pull back from the chance of that gluconeogenesis.

### Pool Things & Weeding (just too long) 

At one point, I just had a pair of needle nose pliers going after the neglected growth that is housed in the cracks next to the pool. *\*sigh\**

### **@thePool: Cardio** (4-4:45pm) 

I just ran around with a skimmer in hand.  

## Retrowave

This has become one of my favorite songs to train to on *Beat Saber*.  Now, I have already recognized The Weeknd is *Michael Jackson Meets Synthwave*.  Today is the first time I have seen this videoâ€”it totally confirms my take.  I want to build myself into THIS:
