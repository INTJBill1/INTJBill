## Thematic Elements

Regarding this website, I have championed for this season's neutral tones and its focus on typography.  And yet, I feel as though its spirit is lost.  Not that anyone cares about thatâ€”what audience do I have (as if that was a motivator)?  No, this place has always been my own oasis.  I suppose in application, it is just a peg above a Word doc.  When it comes to the passage of time, any aesthetics play the role of car wax.  What is left after twenty years?  It does amuse that in a post from June 4, 2003, I reference morning routines I previously did at "Bartlett Rec."

Recently, I have written about my desire to bring retrowave, something that ran in parallel to my 2018, 2019 and thereafter successes.  Just the other day, my wife surprised me with a *fantastic* gift, a [Stranger Things Retro Arcade Desk Mat](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81bpPPYn7WL._AC_SL1500_.jpg).  In the upcoming week, I should be rolling out something different, yet something that fits into that 2018/2019 theme, just evolving it to 2023.

## Fitness

I did NOT fat fast yesterday.  Oh, I nearly did!  I was sitting at 3 grams of protein at 7:30 PM.  But, with the holiday the next day, I chose another night of binges on *Breaking Bad* and chicken wings (no, they were not of Los Pollos Hermanos).  Still, I managed to hit 78 grams of protein for the day, just 3 over my limit.  

I suppose It is uncharacteristic of me to have a late night thereby skipping my morning routine, but I recognize that in this sixth week of training, things are different.  The training will shift.  I do not want to train to be trained to train at a gym.

My diet remains largely the same, though I look forward to the re-emergence of beef.  There was just a bit of work to get through that 50 lb box of Gordon's chicken wings.  The protein average is the lowest of all 32 Expeditions.  At 211 grams of fat, I am at the middle:  should I pull it back to 200 or ramp it up to 220?
