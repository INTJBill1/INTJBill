## Fitness

Whether serendipitous or ignominious, the features  of the path that lies ahead remains to be seen in this adventure for I had to power down my Legs workout this morning.   

I warmed up with shadowboxing, completed my 5 sets of squats and then moved on to my unweighted leg extensions, an exercise that had plans to elevate the rep amount. I sat down, began cranking that second exercise out and...

Pain.  

Earlier that morning, I bristled against something in my squats—I did not drive so deeply.  I knew I had something going on before my first rep, but I thought I could wing it and I thought I had by overcoming my squats—they can be stressful on my lower body.  But unweighted leg extensions?  C'mon, they are oh so simple!  Something was wrong.  

I do not mind sore pain in a workout; *sharp* pain, on the other hand, scares me.  It just felt like my right patella was scraping along with each rep.  The amusing thing is that specific exercise is the easiest of the day and is [just there for my quad rehab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9GeYH1xzIA).  Truly, it is the *last* one of the *entire* week I would expect as a showstopper.  

Where to go from here?  I was thinking of reworking my Wednesdays anyway into something unique.  Never have I found generic leg resistance workouts of interest.  In practice, I would align myself with skill abilities with my legs rather than with strength and aesthetics alone.  I want every day to be a blast for my workout, something that would be a hallmark of the day.

### Google Sheets

If you are interested in ease of readability, or a quicker/cleaner way to ensure your entering data on the right day with Google Sheets, for a while now, I have been lovin' using this bit of code on a conditional formatting with dates running down a column.  It is as if I highlighted the entire row for today.  Of course, the day can be adjusted by a bit of +/- math on the TODAY function:

    =COUNTIF($A1:$FW1, TODAY())

### Dungeons & Dragons

I have been adopting more into my approach to being a DM in DnD.  Curiously, I am finding value in moving away from tech during the game itself.  That is right: I prefer lower tech for DnD, technologies like paper.  I do not refrain from copper and gold applications entirely—things pop up like "What are the stats involved when someone chooses a fight to the death with a raccoon?"

That said, there is a lot of preparation I can do to be more effective in the moment.  This is an analogy for life as well:

Uniquely equipped with both strengths because of my INTJ capabilities, I appreciate the timestamp below of David Harbour's take on what a good DnD party needs:  

> You need people that are gonna play by the rules and then you need people that are gonna break the rules...if you have too many good students it's just not that fun and if you have too many rule breakers you can't get anything done and nothing moves.
