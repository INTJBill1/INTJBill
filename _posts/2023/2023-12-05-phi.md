I have a weigh-in coming up this Sunday as I am in my 6th week of this high-fat carnivore renewal.  While I'll continue to post my numbers, the only meaning they have is for a fella who's my height, your 25 lbs is gonna be a ride different than my tow package.  I've considered BMI as a bridge of relevancy, but that makes no distinction between fat and thin.

Therefore, I'll be plug-n-chuggin' my shoulders and waist measurements toward achieving the Golden Ratio, i.e., 1.618 (φ)—wouldn't the Phi symbol make a *great* Cricut cutout?  This is not my invention; it is plastered all across the *World Wide* Web—hey, there are a lot of fat people out there!

That said, I don't want to minimize the impact of what happens on the scale—I absolutely *must* drop the weight to make **φ**.  But, I'm ready to take it to the next level and build the body I want.  Just settling for what is subpar—namely, giving up on yourself—is both reprehensible and repugnant.
