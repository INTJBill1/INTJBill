## 101 Day

Passing with no fanfare yesterday sans this site's footer,  I hit *100 Days of Carnivore* Today, I've traced the steps of  16% of my last Carnivore adventure—OK, so I'll just ignore that little tidbit.  But, I'm going after it.  A heavy whipping cream-less path to August 19, 2024. 

*"To Infinity and Beyond!"*

## I’m Your Huckleberry:  Now Witness the Firepower of This Fully Armed and Operational Battle Station

I am rethinking my strategy of once we purchase this house to not Hulk smash the support wall between the living / kitchen space and add all of our other *wants*.  Instead, our contractor will address just the repairs needed before we move in. And after I learned of the labor markup for flooring, I knew I'd gonna start leveling up my skillset. 

See, the problem is that I want to get a truck around 18-20K from Carvana.  In life, I've learned that car notes are not something I want.  And yet, I've also learned in an American South context, a family only needs one vehicle...mostly.  Again, when single, I functioned quite well when I gave my truck up for a bicycle—those are years bygone.  

*Sidebar: And again, I've never needed an automobile in Europe, but Europeans seem to do a better job recognizing the collective thing over the individual—but what do they know: they'd all be speaking Russian if it wasn't for American might, ingenuity and economics.* 

There's some justification as to why a second vehicle could provide me with $20K of value over time.  

So, I'm wondering about the affordability of everything I want in context to a house downpayment, a truck, appliances, new tools...my fear is costs unforeseen.  And, I *really* like budgeting!  I've been hanging my hat on the idea of buying only what I need right now for a project; that mindset ought to apply across the board.  Do I really need the wall down *right now*?  

In the future, I'll stand at the podium and say, "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!"
