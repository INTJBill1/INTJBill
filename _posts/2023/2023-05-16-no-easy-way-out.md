## Training of the Day

While not as impactful as yesterday's foundation (how could it ever be), today plattered an effective serving:

### #1: The Incline Bench

I squeezed something new to my strength regimen: a proper warmup involving those 16 oz. gloves.  Just that 5-minute warmup ratcheted me up to take those dumbbells to task.  While I was unsure if I ought to lead into a heavier weight into future renditions of the 1st exercise as it seemed easier, but contextually, it was the first out the door, I totally knew that I outperformed last week's final exercise, DB incline flys.  So, I noted it down for next week.

Speaking of which, an updated version of my doc template.  It is still not there yet.

I was stoked to have earned the *May Gains* Garmin badge:

*Join this challenge and record a total of four hours of strength activities in May.*

You would think that one would be "Super easy. Barely an inconvenience."  But, it does not count rest between sets.  So that 45-minute session?  Yeah, don't count it.  It is the time I am actively doing the reps.  I am proud of pulling off that badge!

The clock ticked 4:44 AM, leaving me with no time for the shadowbox at the end.  So, I strapped on my 2lb weighted gloves and drove off to the gym.

### #2: The Tedious Cardio 

It was an uneventful 30-minute ride on the elliptical this morning.  I did want things to be more focused and not ride it out with a checkmark, so I shored up things and cut things off earlier.

### #4: The Intervals Backwards

Now, this is a new area for me, so it is not as mapped out.  I spent 10 minutes walking on the track.  With the width ends, I'd jog backwards.  Thus, it was more of an interval workout in terms of distance.  I may consider setting up a Garmin schedule to make this time-based, though should I do this on a rest day for my running?

### #5:  BRC Outdoors

I ended things with a ~30-minute walk around the outdoor BRC track.  It was my best pace for that track thus far, though not overall.  It may be something I will track in the future per track.

### #6:  Refuel

Critical to everything, there was the post-workout meal.  Yes, by definition, I intermittently fast every day.  But, that is not even in my program.  It is just what I do.  I'd have to think I am walking in my ancestors' footstepsâ€”who would chase after game in the afternoon after the morning's run?

Standard stuff:

* 3.3 oz of cooked bacon
* 2 eggs
* 1 tbsp of bacon drippings
* 5 oz of cooked ground beef

I am considering dialing back on my morning butter from 12 to 10 tbsps for my 16 oz iced coffee so I can bring it back to that 200-gram fat mark.  The protein was a bit high, though 9 days in, the average for this Expedition is at 70 grams.

## The Walking Dead Inspiration

Over the weekend, I binged all 24 episodes of the final season of *The Walking Dead*.  Now, I was running out of time with my subscription to pull off that feat, so I maxed the speed out to a paltry 1.5x.  The experienced reminded me of my time with audiobooks and everything I pulled down and applied at that 3.0x pace.  Sure, I can no longer subscribe to the Brooklyn Library, but there are still resources out there.  I can do it again.  And when I am on the elliptical or outdoors, why not multithread the event?  The acquisition of knowledge is the spice of life.
