## Woodworkers

Among the recent YouTube woodworkers I've enjoyed, the author of this video, [*What's the Best Wood Joint \|\| Insanely Strong Joinery!*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CE147Ow7RmM) has been delightful at 1.25x speed.  That's not exactly the most definitive video on the topic as further trials are required, but Future Me is gonna have to call miter joints off the bench. 

Another woodworker is out of Monticello, Arkansas.  Sure, his content is informative, but I was amused with [his road trip with his wife in *Where To Buy Wood For Woodworking Projects Local and Online*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtB-yIQ3b6U).

And with yet another woodworker, if Lady Gaga never went the glam route and chose instead to be creatively industrious, she might of had [Tamar's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@3x3CustomTamar).

## Fitness

Soon, I shall be concentrating on a return to fitness.  Oh, it is not about weightloss; I'm excelling there.  Rather, I am more interested in the possibilities.  I atrophied in Memphis.  It explains the leg injury in August 2022, one in which my knee remains to this day a little swollen and tight.  I came to Memphis two years ago high-flying.  Somewhere, I crashed to the Earth.  In my move away from the country, I had left behind a dumbbell set, an elliptical, a treadmill, a vertical climber, a heavy bag, a speed bag, a pull-up/dip station, a couple of benches, an exercise ball, and a curl bar—there was even a Bowflex PR1000 that was worthless beyond its use a third bench!  That was *all* mine and I gave it up to be...*here*.  

Yes, I briefly joined the YMCA in Memphis.  The pool was great, but outside of a row machine?  I took a couple of steps back for my gym space.  I spent most of my time in the pool where that asinine mask mandate didn't apply. Having that lane booked in advance contributed further motivation for those mornings.  The true value of my time spent there was in its externalities: the daily program, separating that space from the rest of my day and the mental clarity of the drive.    

## Music

In that move to Memphis, along with my tools and my fitness equipment, I left my music behind.  Oh, I was never good.  I did it to be absorbed into the music—heck, I got a lot of jollies just out of playing Rocksmith on the PC back in 2013-2014 in Alaska with my electric hooked up via USB.  No, it is not a performance thing; it is just being swept up.  The resonation feels my soul.  Here are a few of my favorite plays:

* [*Take My Breath Away*](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=F4M6haOFtcE&feature=share)
* a crescendoing [*Battlestar Galactica* theme](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=1FXn-EPB3sg&feature=share)
* Eddie Vedder's [Guaranteed](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=K6g4841NZ6I&feature=share)
* Billy Corgan's [Disarm](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=x5GG_fr8WyM&feature=share)
* Or if I wanted to tune down to drop D, Dave Grohl's [*Everlong*](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=YLRlOvzs-XU&feature=share)

...and of course, the chorus I have been able to play since I was 22, Paul Simon's [Homeward Bound](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=4c87TeR7Evs&feature=share)

In time, [I'm going back](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=wZteC1Ids0A&feature=share).
