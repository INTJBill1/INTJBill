## The Power of AI

I am starting to view ChatGPT as my writing buddy.  Oh, it won't run off with my voice.  And I've got Grammarly to remind me to watch for Grammar's speed traps.  I find that ChatGPT is handy for me to paste a long article so that it may summarize it for me and also be able to answer any further questions I might have.  That's just sci-fi stuff to me!
