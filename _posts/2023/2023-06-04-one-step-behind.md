I picked up a win yesterday: after missing last weekend's mark, I was able to fat fast successfully.  In light of doing it, I am now below the threshold average of 75 grams of protein per day, tying 28E...but, that may or may not be jacked up a bit today.  I would not be opposed to running it back for another day.

I ought to define my version of a fat fast since folks have their own versions.  I just strip out the protein macro (inasmuch as I can).  I apply the same structure as I do water fast.  In the same fashion as I do not limit water intake, I do not limit fat. I mean, I guess technically there's a calorie drop-off if that was important—a dropoff in the 100-300 range.  But, there are those who also limit fat intake with respect to normal consumption thereby dropping their total calorie consumption for the day to a non-satisfying, semi-starving 1000-1200 kcal.  Well geez, Beav, fast then!

Overall, it is something weekly I do that is unique to this Expedition as I stamp out sugar, even that from protein.

Fat fast is a bad term—if it was not for the alliteration, I would drop the nomenclature altogether...

...but, I do love alliteration.  

I've been watching [*Fat Head*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcNPfZlrZs) (2009), an amusing rebuttal to Spurlock's *Supersize Me* (2004) (a film I once took stock in during that era).  I like Naughton's perspective because...well, its a bit of practical wisdom.  And it's totally irreverent to Spurlock and calls him out for his chicanery.  And hey, even with my sugar firewall, I totally could lose weight at McDonald's, too.  Does butter there have sugar?  

McD's coffee, butter, burger, eggs.  Booya!  FTW.
