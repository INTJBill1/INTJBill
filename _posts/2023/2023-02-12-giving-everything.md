## The Next Day: *5:37 AM & Me*

Yesterday was decidedly NOT a red-letter day for me.  I woke up with *sharp & shocking* inflammation in my right knee from something I re-tweaked while moving boxes the other day; at one point, I had to use a crutch to back off the tension. Later, my right ring finger was slammed in a drawer full of clothes.  I then canceled $800 worth of tools because Amazon was playing whack-a-mole in its logistics network—I knew NEVER to go with Amazon for I chose to go with specific vendors YEARS ago while out in the country.  I discovered our house seller thinks contract language is just a mild suggestion.  Finally, I drove by a potential house alternate in Bartlett of what was once a nice neighborhood that hence has fallen, proving once again that my beloved, entropic hometown is deteriorating.  And, this all comes on the 19th anniversary of my father's passing.

Teetering on the edge of radioactive oblivion  
A three-hundred thousand-degree baptism by nuclear fire  
I'm not sorry, we had it coming

So, it wasn't the best of days.  What will TODAY look like?  Although my ring finger HATES me for the above paragraph and the zone it has to cover on this keyboard, it's going to be a day full of *win*.  I've got a big ol' list of things to figure out and that's where I really shine.

## Arriving at Port

I had that dream again last night.  That dream where I am running.  But this time, I was running among an AI-generated crowd of friends that encourage me.  In my dream, I felt I was slow, though they seemed mindlessly happy with my effort.  Bewildering.

This is the last day of *The 29th Expedition*.  It started with my second day back on Facebook and ends with me being alone.  Revisiting my past, trying to recapture those old moments...well, we can't do that sans a DeLorean and 1.21 *"jigawatts."*  The pieces no longer snap together.  I have bits of fabric but not enough to form the tapestry.

I was curious of what Kelly said in the video I referenced yesterday about her joining a Crossfit gym for a 40+ class.  That idea really intrigues me.  Instead of *the grasping of the wind* of past efforts, I'm curious to be a part of a community, a tribe, with a drive within that lines up to my own desires—a push through our own inner strength toward winning.  I'm sure there are all sorts of interpretations of Crossfit beyond my characterization of it beyond screaming and a "Bruh, how much can you lift" from a raspy-voiced woman.
