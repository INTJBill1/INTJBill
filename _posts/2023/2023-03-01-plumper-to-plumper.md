## Spinnin’ the Big Wheel for That $1.00

We have a pool that is open.  We HAVE a pool that is OPEN!  

Who knew that something that once seemed so insignificant would be a turning point in a contract negotiation?  After that last house where that scoundrel was pulling all the tricks out to not do it, we actually have a seller who wants to sell a house,  a seller that is motivated out of his own economic self-interests.  Is a rational approach just a Bartlett thing?  Maybe lead paint never made it onto the walls over there?

I mean, *I would think* it's readily obvious that if I were to sell a house with a pool, I'd have it open for an inspection.  But, I am of Bartlett.  The other two places I've walked from, I didn't even know I *could* inspect the pool—that shootin' from the hip, the dual agent never gave a heads up—and that last one...I bristle.  You can't hide a cracked pool, folks.  

So, we've got our dynamic duo of our inspector with our contractor at the new place today.  It's weird to not yet buy a house and think in terms of what you'll do five years down the road in adding equity.  That "forever home" is a bit of a misnomer.  Life has so many variables that a few pop out of our arms.  The only place like that has some exquisite craftmanship of pearl on the front gates and it's over in New Jerusalem.  Heck of a time getting over there, however!

## Carmageddon 2023 

Yesterday, I found out that Harbor Freight is running a deal that with the purchase of a cordless tool, you get a free battery.  A week ago, I bought both, but they have a 30-day policy where they honor it retroactively.  $40 for free!  Maybe a new toy!  So, off I went to the Collierville location...and that was NOT the one I should have picked.  

Now, I did shop for 15 minutes.  But, I was out for...TWO hours.  It's Mad Max out there: a blown-up motorcycle; a high-speed wreck; a stalled, budget "car" on an interstate overpass; a slammed SUV that was in the Chic-Fil-A drive-thru on an arterial road; and lastly the collector road near my house that had all three lanes of incoming traffic blocked as guys pushed shop brooms around a wreck.  

I was beat.  I don't remember Memphis traffic being so daunting back in 2012.
