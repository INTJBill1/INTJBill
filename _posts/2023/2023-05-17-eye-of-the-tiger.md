## Song of the Day

I never intended for the following to be today's song and frankly, I am sure it was a part of a prior Expedition, even if that Expedition's playlist has been lost along the way.  Yet, this song closed out today's resistance workout.  Before slipping my phone into my Flipbelt onto my back, I pressed the loop button, thinking the playlist would repeat since my phone would be inaccessible.  Nope, THAT did not happen.  So, I drove up to the gym this morning, blaring *Eye of the Tiger* again and again.  It is no *Everlong*, but I got into the groove nevertheless.

Not the version, but I like the recall of when I was a season ticket holder in '21 and feeling so thin...wanting to give away the XL apparel I caught from the t-shirt cannon because it was too big.

## Training of the Day

Overall, while I felt I worked my body over effectively today, it does not show with my Garmin stats...so in time, it will look like today was underwhelming.  That said, it was the first day I emerged in 2021's take: long-sleeved rash guard and spats along with my Sanabul combat shorts with my Flipbelt underneath.

### #1: Quad City DJ

1. 5-min Shadowbox
2. Squats*
3. Leg Extensions
4. Step Ups
5. Calf Raises (ran out of time to finish sets 4 and 5)
6. ~~Shadowbox~~

\* - This is the first time I did NOT do a Bob & Brad assisted squat, but added light dumbbells to see my status.  I will up the amount next week.

Won't be long now

### #2: The Gym

I invested a mere 11 minutes into the arc trainer this morning.  While I doubled up my band-aids this morning, my switch to a thin sock stripped away the protection to prevent my shoe from sawing into my heel.  As soon I felt that, I stepped off the machine.

I immediately kicked off workout #2 into my couch-to-5K program. The heels were not an issue, but I absolutely HATE my speed.  I need to build up my legs, but also revisit the ChiRunning technique.  I will have to find a metronome for my phone that plays atop music.

At the same time, I recognize I am starting out around 15 lbs heavier than I did in 2021 and do not have all of the hours on a treadmill as I did before.

I ended things with a 2nd ride atop the spin bike, going for a 1:1 minute ratio between the saddle and climbing for a total of 10 minutes. I will up it next week.  I like having that session after the run.  

### #3 The Carnivore

Thus far, today is a 190/76 gram day.  I do find that my body is adapting quickly to the loaded stress.  Again, the below the knee ache I once felt on just 2 laps of the track from walking is very fresh on my mind!  And less than 2 months ago, I could not lift my leg up an inch off the bed!  My descent down the stairs is not as controlled as I like, but in time, this, too, will change.  

It is true that carnivores are resilient against the Sun's rays.  I was unprotected outdoors yesterday from 1:30 - 3:00 PM with my shirt off (and shaved head) and I did not burn.  My back took the brunt of the Sun as I pulled up stalks and honeysuckle brambles from what was once a raised bed.  The biggest issue I had with the event that my forearms came away itchy from those plants.  I could not wash it down with Dawn fast enough.  Plants hate me.
