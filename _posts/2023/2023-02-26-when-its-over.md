## Walkin' in Hawkins

The mirage is over. The seller ran ramshod over our final offer—he ignored it just as he did for the contract requirement to open the pool in 5 days for inspection.  He countered at $17.5 of $30K...$30K of line-by-line for 5 pages of repairs with thumbnails—not aesthetics like that kitchen that compels you to lose weight as your stomach churns—REPAIRS!  He countered and rolled the dice on a place when if he just signed off on our offer, he would have doubled his money!  Doubled it on a place where he walked into his ex-wife's pickup of a foreclosure and...umm....there was a lot of good TV on over the years?

Could have doubled his money in a low-turnover, local market.  I gotta pull this one out again for yet ANOTHER seller:

Yeah, his $17.5 offer would not have even covered the house repairs, much less touched that leaking pool with the holes he tried to weld together between our first and \**ahem*\* second pool inspections.  If we fixed it ourselves, it would set us back $10K.  Sure, he featured that pool in his listing since October, but it was no more than a hole in the ground where one HOPES its "lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea" [don't involve me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxY5U81-w9E) or my house.  He could have just walked away with a wheelbarrow of cash without worrying about the fixes.  

I can never understand sellers. Much less want a place of one Upside Down or another.

## Another Place...as a “Temporary” Landlord?

We were going to throw in an offer on another place, but we discovered that the sellers don't want to move out.  I mean, sure, they EVENTUALLY want to leave (*right?*), but they just wanted to know what it was like to be a tenant for a bit or *something*.  The thing is, I *kinda* want to move out of my current place—that's also *sorta* my incentive to city planning all of this cardboard cityscape in my living room.  Shifting a mortgage payment AND monthly rent from the seller to the buyer just ain't my bag.  Introduces all sorts of risk and...well, what do I gain?  I'm not getting that choice windfall at the end.
