Hello Thursday!  I never believe that we are more than halfway through May, less than two weeks from June, for all intents and purposes, summer!  My summer 2019 callback: *One summer can change everything.*

 I totally need to recreate that summer playlist of mine!

I admit, I do miss owning a treadmill.  I miss those days of hopping aboard every day for a couple of hours, watching a Tom Cruise movie from that stash of that going-out-of-business video rental shop or a UFC event, which was kicked off with DVDs from said store before my subscribing.  I created a fantastic gym.

That said, I do like what I am building. 

## The Morning

It was another Shoulders day, which was a bit more of a push than I expected.  I am guessing it had something to do between the shadowboxing and the weights I held for yesterday's Legs.

I headed up to the gym and just did a sampling of the buffet.  I did 15 minutes on the elliptical.  Then I proceeded to do 15 minutes on the indoor track.  And while I did the moving-in-reverse bit, I just did not have it in me to do those segments while jogging.  I am guessing the extra hour I did of VR cardio yesterday afternoon may of had a bigger impact than I thought in resetting my recovery.  I ended with trying out the course I created on Garmin, which was just the BRC outdoor track.  While I thought I pushed, my pace was slower than on Tuesday.  NOT a red-lettered day thus far.

When I came home, I was tapped.  I pulled together my food.  At its end, I downed something new I am adding again to my diet:  a teaspoon of powdered eggshells.  I figured with all of this structural stuff going on, the calcium boost cannot hurt.  

I do not know where I will show up on the scale on June 19.  I would think it is unlikely that I will beat my Keto/Carnivore opponent this time around with his -5.91% loss—I will come close to his 14 lb weightloss—but I fully expected to destroy the next 24 weeks thereafter after that weigh-in.  

All that aside, my clothes are looser.  I wore my Black Rifle Coffee t-shirt for the first time to the gym today.
