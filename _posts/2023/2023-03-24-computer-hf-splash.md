## Garbage In, Garbage Out

I got riled up this morning around 4 AM with a COMPUTER!  Gotta admit, that was a first.  Sure, I have been frustrated, depressed, entertained and elated with one, but it is nothing like this.  My turn came up to try [Bard](https://bard.google.com/), Google's AI...Google's *liberal* AI.  Right off the back, it was promoting a vegan diet.  Yay.  I asked it this, "If a vegan diet requires fortified foods or vitamin supplements, how can it be a complete diet?"  Google Bard acknowledged that the diet required that, but said this does not mean a vegan diet is incomplete.  Wha?  Zounds!  Not everything is included?!  That is the VERY meaning of incomplete!  

And then I talked about the economy, Trump v. Biden.  And you can bet which side it took.  It stated Trump's absolute success was based on external factors (and somehow it added that emotional sentiment got him elected), yet Trump added to the debt.  With Biden, ol' Liberal Bard said specific things about how Biden has addressed the FAILING economy and it has only been "1 1/2 years" into his administration and to give him time.  

I should not be surprised that a computer created by a whole mess of liberals ought to be liberal.  I know there is just an expectation of neutrality—a fairness—with a non-emotional computer.   That is how I would create my robot.  I mean, yeah, sure, it would STILL take over the world, but it would be fair when doing so. 

Verily, GIGO.

Speaking of working with my hands, I was delighted that my pest control guy recognized the YouTube show I had paused when he came over and said the title before I could, [*Unashamed*](https://www.youtube.com/@PhilRobertsononBlazeTV) (I whiffed on a *Duck Commander*  Geez, me!)

## My Summer Splashin'

Yesterday, I spent two hours in my pool for the first time.  63° is my favorite air temperature, but it is NOT my preferable water temperature.  Still, the chill of the pool REALLY invigorated me!  I went through my training routine—well, no jump turning round kicks, I mean, my knee is injured afterall and I...well, forgot that.   

This morning was the first time I have been able to raise my right leg as it is extended on the bed AND when sitting down in a chair since moving here.  Before, it was nada on the bed and I might be able to move it an inch or two if I strained hard while sitting.  It remains swollen, but I continue to work it by bending it to the point of swollen uncomfortability and then percuss it like a caged, crazed monkey staring at a banana!  I am SO happy that I am now in a position I can strengthen my quad; I am even considering on a future race schedule—hey, it has been DAYS since I dropped those crutches, my old man cane.
