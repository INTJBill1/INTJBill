Facebook is a time suck.  While I intended it to be a minor addition to *Destination '23*, Facebook has played an outsized role.  While I'm not jazzed up by Facebook's random content spam; its treatment of YouTube embeds; or its inappropriate, hosted videos (eye-popping for a family-orientated space), this is not the primary concern. No, what troubles me is the amount of time I must mine for words.   As that resource has to come from somewhere, that somewhere is this site.

And what I say on that platform is such a narrow band.  I don't go to it undecided; it does not propel me to action in the real world.  Facebook reminds me of technical writing:  get in and get out fast; say what your main point in the beginning since folks fade fast.  And really, it's all about the hook.  

Honestly, it comes off a lot like this:

*To what end?*

That's the question I ask of so many things; I ask it now.

Why do I entertain on Facebook?  To some extent, it's what we do to complete the pleasure. C.S. Lewis writes,

>I think we delight to praise what we enjoy because the praise not merely expresses but completes the enjoyment; it is its appointed consummation. It is not out of compliment that lovers keep on telling one another how beautiful they are; the delight is incomplete till it is expressed. It is frustrating to have discovered a new author and not to be able to tell anyone how good he is; to come suddenly, at the turn of the road, upon some mountain valley of unexpected grandeur and then to have to keep silent because the people with you care for it no more than for a tin can in the ditch; to hear a good joke and find no one to share it with.

Of course, it is not the only reason.  It also develops relationships and acquires knowledge.  But, it is a lot like going to yard sales on a Saturday morning as I look for that thing in the rough.  And somehow, I don't think I'll be stopping by Daylight Donuts afterward.

I'll have to release an updated version of *Destination '23* to better guide my expectations—totally do NOT make it a part of my 3 AMs.  Ultimately, I gotta ensure that objectives are optimized so that the whole ship sails most effectively.
