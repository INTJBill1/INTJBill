Well, I did it:  I returned to my sacrosanct 3 AM.  But, it *totally* comes with an asterisk attached as it's on the heels of the time change.  And thus, I woke up at 4 AM?  And I'm not *even* back to the 2:30 AM of the spring-summer.  

Speaking of the summer, since that July, some four months ago, I gained a whole 8 INCHES around my bellyâ€”I am just pregnant with ideas!  You know I am *stoked* about that!  Ahh, give it time for I'm the wizard of weightloss...(*and weightgain come to think of it*).

Ahh, FTW.

I'm not lifting weights this morning; I'm not heading up to the BRC in a few; I'm not slapping the sandals on to tear up the sidewalk.  No, I'm just in the moment...restoring balance...drinking coffee in the solace of the night...preparing and marking down notes for what lies ahead...

I am a huge fan of Todoist Pro.  Although I've just started, I've got around 300 items to address and a lot of them are merely placeholders like "design a running program."  Yeah, a paper version of this would be OVERWHELMING!  I like the AI integration for subtasks to brainstorm where to start, though not as much [as this YouTuber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yshcwFbbj10).  Hey, I got tacos down flat *(see opening segment of this post)*.

I've been applying Todoist shorthand for task entry...

- **\#** for projects... 
- **@** for labels... 
- **!** for a specific time...
- **p3** for Priority 3...  

...there's value in triaging our lives.  

Naturally, for a new project, I'll add an emoji that best typifies a project name with a matching color.  It's helpful for me to find projects rapidly.  I mean, it's no fighter pilot HUD, but an errant squirrel might catch my attention if I don't find the project fast enough.

However, it has been like herding cats to organize *all* of these tasks down into their respective project boxes. In time, I'll get this gray tabby into its own corner of the box!

*(Squirrel!)*
