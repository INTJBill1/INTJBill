## The Workshop

Yesterday, I took the first steps toward creating something very special, something that...well, something that will span across this year and all the years that remain: *The Workshop of INTJBill*—I am SO gonna have to make a sign with that! I dropped, I don't know, $2600 into tools to recapture the spirit of what was to ignite the fires of what will be. And it looks like I'll be picking up a Harbor Freight membership shortly—and I don't even have a lick of a tool cabinet unlike my prior iteration when I had that Craftman's rolling delight. I've got ideas for a WAY cheaper solution. Just lemme at that wood! Oh, don't let me get ahead of myself! That will be rolling out later this year.

Oh, *The Workshop* has been sorely missed in my life! From the emergence of my weightloss project to the subsequent banishment of sawdust, to this relegation to *Walking in Memphis* in the footsteps of yesteryear, it has been too far long—almost seems like a lifetime ago! Sure, I can tool around with this website and do a thing or two. I might even toss in a smattering of words to capture a thought. But, I feel most alive when I create with my hands.

In time, I'll be sharing my woodworking project of the month.

## All-in With Google

While I said my final goodbye to Facebook (and I had to delete every single post and delete every single person to pull myself away), I am doubling down on Google. I've purchased a year's worth of YouTube Premium for YouTube Music. In time, I hope to recreate past Expeditions playlists and will link them here.

Spotify has an advantage product because of its push to user-generated playlists. That said, Spotify cannot give me Rock Sugar's *[Roll You in the Hurricane](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=eMLhxHFhIsI&feature=share)* in a playlist!

And because of YouTube, I ran across Sandi Thorn's *[November Rain](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZE28fKxTpA&feature=share)*, which I think might be more emotionally hitting than the original. And while she's Scottish, I'd have never guessed it! She's reminiscent of Trisha Yearwood.

Lastly, I punched up my Google One storage to 200 GB and have something like 400-something days ahead with them.

This is a new era. A new era of artificial intelligence art. The [Tech Noir](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=wCq2sj1zBQg&feature=share) is NOW.
