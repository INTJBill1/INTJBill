I've got half the mind to shut down this site for good.  See, I tend to talk to myself when I've got another Rubix's Cube in my life.  You shoulda seen me in my workshop with a pencil doing the math on my bench—you'd think I was hosting a talkshow!  

This place isn't expensive to run; 2022's domain + hosting set me back me all of $19.64.  While it's a few bucks more than a bag of Black Rifle Coffee from the Bass Pro Shop at the Pyramid, the shelf life is oh so much better!  

But, I got to thinking: I don't need to weaken/remove my presence here—I need to go FULL THROTTLE!  This is more than a place to flip a few words onto their heads; it's a place to get things done!

This site spearheads my projects.  I think without it, I'd watch ol' Lorelai, Michael Scott or Barney Fife and go on a run through the entire catalogs of Little Debbie, Blue Bell and Lay's. 

Now, that's one corpus that makes a body a corpse!

Tangentially relevant: one of my more endearing memories was getting off work providing IT support for Germantown Baptist in 2002.  Across the street from the church, I'd pick up a snack bag of California Dill Pickle Lay's Chips and a 20 oz bottle of Vanilla Coke.  Then for that long I-240 South drive back to Jackson Ave, I'd listen to...

...the Counting Crows' *Hard Candy* (2002)...

...Creed's *Weathered* (2001)...

....Nickleback's *Silver Side Up* (2001)...

...or Weezer's *Pinkerton* (1996).  

I recall a December evening in that space with embers of Sun on the horizon.  Flowing my arm out the window of that Chevy Silverado, winter was stinging as I listened to Counting Crows' track, *Miami*...

It's all so long ago but it was yesterday.  I feel like I could be pulling into a parking spot at the Mug and run into a roomful of friends...  

And here I am.

Tangent aside, if I may borrow from an album that played heavy in my rotation from way back when, *All That You Can't Leave Behind* (Fall 2000): I just might *Walk On* from Stars Hollow, Scranton and Mayberry.  Maybe it's time to board the Galactica...
