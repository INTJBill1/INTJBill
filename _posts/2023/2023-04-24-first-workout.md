## 3:30 AM: VR Wakeup/Warmup

My initial reaction as I kicked things off this morning was that I need more time!  Sure, I had my coffee, butter and ice already set to transform into my morning drink, but I didn't set aside my keys, wallet or clothes for the morning.  I gonna have to reexamine my 3:30 AM activity.  Honestly, a 3:20 AM would have eased up things.  

And thus, it totally ate into my VR time.  I only did one song, that video I posted the other day with the Black Panther. I hit all 400-whatever boxes and still only came in 2nd place on my personal best.  It was a good way to get up to speed on being alert.

## 4:00 AM: Resistance, Back

My 55 lb NordicTrack Select-A-Weight Dumbbells ~~will arrive~~ were canceled by Amazon today, so I used what I had, a pair of 25 lb DB sand weights, which was adequate for some sets and not enough for others.  I only had 45 minutes before I drove off to the gym and it was not enough time.

* DB shrugs, 5x15
* Stiff-leg DB deadlifts, 5x15 
* DB pullover, 5x15
* Bent over DB row, 3x15

I didn't have enough time with the last one, which is why it was only 3 sets.  I wanted a 5th exercise, but again...yes, not enough time.  Now for this new start, instead of a rest of 45 seconds between sets as I have done in the past, I gave myself a full minute.

## 5:00 AM: Cardio @theGym

You know what's a wild ride?  Thinking a doppelgänger of a friend is the real McCoy.  It's like, "Hey you—oh, wait—nevermind."  I just pedaled on to complete my hour of stationary bike.  Incidentally, I went a tenth further than on Saturday.  A goal of 12 miles seems to be a good target with my current status.

While my plan was to do an inclined treadmill for an additional hour, my leg combined with hitting my head on limited time had me just doing a third of it.

Overall, I need to smooth out the rough edges of my program.  Oh, there's yard work that awaits today and my pool time, but those are straightforward.  It bugs me that I had to wait longer for Amazon to deliver the dumbbells until today and they just canceled it for no reason.  That said, I don't mind putting $383 back into my pocket.
