## That Last Vestige of My Former Life

I am on the verge of making another shift in my diet. 

Now, I know it is difficult to understand what ounces mean in real-world values.  Like bacon.  Sure, I try to bridge the gap by saying I slice the package right down the middle, cook one half and shelf the other.  But in cooked ounces, this can vary between 2 to 5—she is a temperamental lady:  you pay only half-attention to her (not flipping regularly) and she will have slimmed down and is out on the prowl!  No one wants snappy bacon, unless it is to adorn those poisoned leaves.  

That said, right now, I am eating the equivalent of 7 ½ strips of bacon a day.  I would like to bump that up, but I am hitting that protein ceiling.  I would like to bump that up because I like bacon.  

And I have considered adding pork belly to the diet, but what protein do I strip out?

* ~7 ½ strips of bacon
* ~3 oz of ground beef
* ~3 oz of liver

The liver can go; it is the McRib of my diet.  And clearly, bacon stays.  So, that leaves me with my ground beef.  This is a crazy stat: I compared the bacon (3 oz) and the ground beef (3.4 oz) of what I ate yesterday.  Almost across the board, amino acids, vitamins and minerals, bacon won hands down.  The only thing the heavier beef took was B12, folate, K, calcium, iron and zinc out of 35 factors.  Bacon wins on fat which I absolutely NEED and...for me—for ALL OF HUMANITY: bacon TASTES better.  

It is an interesting idea for further review. 

This is not why I write.  I think it is *almost* time once and for all to kick coffee to the curb.  It is that *"last 5%"* that makes an outsized impact.  

We get it all wrong, don't we?  We think, "Well, the darn thing 7 calories, what harm could it possibly do to me?"  Look at its influence!  It shapes my morning and hours thereafter!  There is a reason why our brains flag its chemicals as bitter, that we gotta develop a taste for it.  Or as virtually all Starbucks patrons, mask it with carbs. *"I'm your Americano Huckleberry."*  Yes, coffee totally puts me here:

Coffee is my NZT.  It is an enhancement.  I do not drink it to wake up.  I stretch my legs and core, then massage unused muscles for my startup sequence.  I use coffee to...SHAKE AND BAKE!

I *think* I have a replacement carrier for my ghee in lieu of coffee, something I will try out tomorrow: iced water.  I have done this before with unsalted Kerrygold.  It comes off as a watery heavy whipping cream, which likely speaks to my recipe. 

## The Reason Why I Want to Remove That Last Vestige of Coffee

I look around and see my high school graduation group from 27 years ago is largely wilting away.  I hear of the handfuls of poisons neatly cataloged in their daily medicine box.  No doubt they dutifully received the injection by their overlord and chastised others for not putting *Yet Another Foreign Chemical* into their bodies.  "It's from Pfizer so you know it's gotta be good!"  

I am reminded of this dialog from *Fallout 4*:

> **Overseer**: So if they must squander their time, let us turn it to the collective good: with chemistry.	
>  
> **Clem**: {Worried} What? Aren't chemicals bad for you?	
>  
> **Overseer**: Oh, Clem. You worry so much, my boy. Everything you eat and drink is made of chemicals. Don't you know?
>  
> **Clem**: {Relieved} Oh, right. That's very interesting, lady Overseer.	
>  
> **Overseer**: These are just "special" chemicals. \*chuckle\*

Of course, there are those who remain vibrant, but others are but a shell of their former selves.

For whatever reason, people do not think in terms of eating a **species-specific diet**.  Yes, they do not give their dogs bananas or ice cream.  Yes, they know that dogs are animals that do not eat that.  But, it is like they forget that we have a physiology that has remained the same for 1000s of years.  We were meant to eat FAT!  You know that gallbladder?  There's a reason for that thing jammed in there.  Now, doctors, those *smart boys* will tell you that you don't really need that thing.  The body burns calories to maintains it for funzies.  Eh, by *their* logic, I guess I don't really need most of my body.  *Plucks eyes out and rolls them off the table.*  "Now, just snap my brain into an old 286."

> You're usin' a 286? Don't make me laugh  
Your Windows boots up in what, a day and a half?  
You could back up your whole hard drive on a floppy diskette  
You're the biggest joke on the Internet

If we consume too much protein, we die.  And our bodies have no need for carbohydrates.  None.  We do not need that *government-suggested* 65% kcal from carbs.  Not a single %.  Surprise!  We do not need sugar. 

Sidebar: I mean, why listen to them?  They cannot even balance a budget!  They literally believe if you dump wheelbarrows of cash into the economy that you won't get inflation.  Geez—where's the Dad of the United States?

No, civilization got it wrong. I am not talking about the wonders of the 20th century, things like corn syrup and such.   When agriculture kicked in, we became smaller, our cranium capacity dropped—we even had tooth decay!  

Fun fact:  For over 108 days now, I have NOT brushed my teeth.  I do not get that nasty film that coats the tongue and teeth; there is nothing trapped between my teeth sans the occasional meat.  I do not wake up with breath that renders people unconscious.  Why should we be surprised at this if we revert to our species-specific diet?  It is like we almost assume that these things "just happen." Or we just assume we will become fragile as we age.  It's with what we put into our bodies, you big dummy!
