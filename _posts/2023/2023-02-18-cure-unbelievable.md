## AI Art of the Day: *Fingers Crossed*

I'm going to hang up my hat regarding AI art.  I have not been able to find any local renderers that I like; I have used [Mochi Diffusion](https://github.com/godly-devotion/MochiDiffusion) and [Diffusion Bee](https://diffusionbee.com/).  While I have entertained myself with [StableCog.com](https://stablecog.com/), in the end, I am not building value. I need to spend more time with things that have the potential to source up some grub for a plate of Bill fingers.

OK, so it's not as robust as in past years.  I don't have my Spotify Top 100 of 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019—I can't even bring back my Expedition playlists and convert them to YouTube Music!  Some are just gone like a favorite, the even more aptly named, *The Lost 7th Expedition* from 2019, a year in which I lost ALL blog posts.

However the framework for expansion is there!  I've also linked to some of my favorite non-intrusive soundtracks to play when I'm focusing.  YouTube Music gets a bit busy in its interface with the more content I add.
