I have been intending to write for DAYS now!  I have been beleaguered with tasks and projects—OK, *overwhelmed*— and just haven't set aside the time to put something down on paper!

But, it's *good* I've been busy 'cause that's a symptom of being AWESOME!  And yes, I say that from a 2:30 AM alarm this morning.

Now past 15 days, I am in week 3 of *The 34th Expedition*.  As you can see on my [*Intake*](/fit/intake/) page, I've been maintaining the 200+/75 schema and have been rewarded with a big ol' rig hauling VITALITY!  *(Level up me!)*

I do feel really good!  My day-to-day isn't so focused on eating, that is, there's not this mindless devotion to carbs.  Instead, I monitor hunger indicators to see if I need to pop back ~2.5 oz of meat.  One or two days prior, I'll cook burgers so I can just grab 'em when I feel the gauge is low.  For lunch—really my only meal of the day—I'll fry up some bacon and eggs to eat while I'm doing other chores.  Though I have yet to flip on the workout toggles, I already feel online.

The sword-wielding is coming.  I already do a stretching-balance morning routine to bring my body to a ready status.  I just have yet to implement a agility-focused, bodybuilding focus complete with a scaffolding stamina regimen.

That's penciled in to kick off this morning, but as I'm [making bread](/diary/2023-06-22-12am/), I'm finding that I'm squeezing in a blog post instead of a bicep.

So there's room to improve.  Last night while watching our seasonal tradition of *The Lord of the Rings*, specifically [*The Two Towers*](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_morj39eUqBHmc6s6jq9fC1G_9JRDs0SVI), I made my Homeschool agenda spreadsheet again that [uses a script to feed into a doc template](https://jeffreyeverhart.com/2020/09/29/auto-fill-a-google-doc-template-from-google-sheet-data/).  Some time ago, I incorporated that functionality, but it's the sort of thing that's lost when a fella blows up his Google account time and time again.  But hey, Google is on the Software Standards page for 2024!  Yeah, he's nosy as all get out, but outside some number crunching, I share the same on here.

Still, there remain things I need to pick up.  The new year is under 49 days from now; I will be in rhythm on Day 1 with everything I want to accomplish for the year.  I have no interest in stumbling into 2024 with those "Golly, losing weight might be good for the beach" resolutions.  One does not simply walk into Mordor—err, the new year.  *"To what end?"* is both a wise consideration and pragmatic.  We all have our metaphorical junk that needs to be tossed out of the house, why add to the pile?
