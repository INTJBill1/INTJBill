## Out With the Old...

Yesterday's post marks the end of a turbulent house negotiation where we ultimately made good on our walk.  I confess, I don't like this approach of pulling out the nuclear button time and again, but we just *couldn't* get the seller to put on his big boy pants and keep them up!  We first threatened to walk after he failed to open the pool after the contract's 5 days, but gave him a day pass over football.  

On the 6th day, he showed us a suspiciously grainy video of "a pool guy" opening it up to dump some 20 lbs of shock—I'm *sure* he sent a professional like he said he did, a very busy professional with how fast he had to cast aside the pool cover.  

We sent our guy and found the pool to be a lagoon.  It may have been the summer getaway for the frogs in the nearby creek.  The seller claimed to have turned the pool off immediately after his "opening."  We would have to eat another pool inspection at a later date, which nearly didn't happen, because we did ANOTHER ultimatum, 7 days later, when he may or may not have burned up the motor and had to get another...allegedly.  

He got it clear and boy howdy, that subsequent pool inspection saved us cash.  Like I said yesterday, who knows where that water is?  Admittedly, I never trusted that water hose next to the pool.  What, it takes two minutes to pile a hose away?  Cover your tracks, bruh!  

I wanted to leave at that point because of the shenanigans, but I acquiesced.  We went all up and down the place and got a good bead on it. I felt confident that without opening the walls, we knew what was going on, but even that might of been a problem, 'cause there were three light switches in the shower. That fuse box, yes an actual fuse box, looked like [the spaghetti of a network closet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI_qtuprkuM).  We were going to negotiate how much of the repairs we wanted him to set aside in that escrow account.  This time, I wanted all of it:  all $30K.  When that final was countered, we pulled the ejection handle. Just a week from closing.

## ...in With the New.

And today's post is about...well...these characterizations:

Hours after yesterday's post, we put in an offer on another place through some Bill-aligned tactics from our buyer's agent: offer a few thousand above asking, then turn around and ask for all of closing.  And somehow, we found a seller who thinks RATIONALLY 'cause he didn't put on his monkeypants and start dancing; he accepted the offer.  

So, we're back in the game!

Pool's opening is tomorrow, the house inspection is on Wednesday and closing is on the 17th. Bada bing, bada boom.
