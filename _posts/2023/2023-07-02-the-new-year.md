It's a new year!  Fiscal year?  Eh...well, I got a few more days on hand before I level up and hit 45.  In application, this is all about the 2023 New Year's Resolutions—yeah, those things that nobody has paid half-a-mind toward since February.  I pulled it back from "Destinations."  Don't get me wrong, I like the nautical theme.  Pairs nicely with *The Expeditions.*  But, I've got enough I gotta explain.  People know and have expectations of resolutions. 

As I lay in bed last night toward what lies ahead and the requirements thereof, I thought 21 resolutions were *heavy*!  I fiddled around with whittling them down, but shoved that off for the next morning to resolve.  I woke up and really loved the idea of all 21.  MAYBE I might switch out "Custom & Salvage Computing" because I don't want to invest TOO much cash in that.  That said, I like it conceptually because to me, it is no different than restoring a classic car.  And when it comes to custom rigs...the sky is the limit.

While they ought to go largely unnoticed, I cobbled together a few updates for this website.  I am removing my dependence on [FontAwesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/icons) and [Google Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery).  This came to me during the recent power outage and Internet outage.  As I would run my site locally and see how it was hanging, I decided to remove the calls to external API/JS.  Honestly, I prefer just using a system font stack but when I get creative, I will just host it myself. 

Drawbacks?  No cute icons?  Meh: ASCII and emotions are overkill.  No generated charts?  Meh: I'll do it local and take a screenshot.  Honestly, I probably could host it all on my server, but I miss the days when this site was far simpler—no "one-off" things.  

And I decided to rework the nav for a cleaner interface.  Who *doesn't* want a higher signal-to-noise ratio...in everything?
