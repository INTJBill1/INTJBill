## The Carnivore

Today is my day of rest.  At 160 days, today is also where I am beyond 25% of the distance of my prior carnivore experience.  It seems a bit ago since I launched this thing back before Thanksgiving and there really is no stopping me from surpassing that mark in August 2024.  I have learned to stay away from my heavy whipping cream nemesis or any dairy for that matter—no [oopsie cake](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/60zUMtQz3NE)!  And Little Debbie ain't a nurse for my pain.  She'll only cripple me.

I have maintained my High Fat Carnivore (HFC) approach, too, with my 200+ / 75 gram approach.  Now, the protein grams have calculated a little high as they've been in the 80s the past few days, but it is not accurate:  my bacon has been on the floppy side due to my recent oven approach.  Throw 'em in a pan and the weight drops in half as I crisp them up.

Also in the past couple of days, I switched out ground beef for chicken wings.  Again though, it is way too easy to bump my head against the protein threshold.  I make this huge soft taco out of two eggs and stuff it with bacon.  Then I'll eat 4 chicken wings crisped up for 22 min at 400℉ in the air fryer.  It makes for a hearty meal for the day. That's around 73 grams of protein there.  And you kinda can eat more than four!

A HFC approach is easy, optimizes hormones, supports intermittent fasting, drops the weight and loads me up with energy.  In a week, I went from 0-60 like Sammy Haggar [*I Can't Drive 55*](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=2Qf98egLWOk&feature=share) and Steppenwolf's [*Born to Be Wild*](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=igvP806798U&feature=share), empowering a one-legged Bruce Banner on the couch to transform into The Hulk with a weekday morning schedule of 2 ½ hours dedicated to training. 

## @theGym

All that said, the mental game is always the most challenging.  Yesterday's time on at the gym was underwhelming.  OK, it was failing.  As I approached the doors around that Saturday morning's 9 AM, it just didn't feel right; I gotta have my darkness.  I missed the clock edging up to 5 AM.

But, I got in there, went up those stairs and hit the track.  I made remarkable time (for me) and even passed a guy with long legs.  But, I knew my place was in the cardio room so I headed back down.  I climbed about the arc trainer next to this other fella and went to work.  

Unfortunately, one of the benefits of being a carnivore is an enhanced sense of smell. I suppose it came useful back when we ran down prey.  Well, I can readily smell people's scent for which they are unaware.  And that guy next to me was...well, he knew how to carve out his own space.  I began sticking it out as he was stinking me out, but did I want that for the next 50 minutes?  So, I hopped off my machine, wiped it down and headed to the treadmill. 

So, I fired it up, set it to 7% and went to work.  Unfortunately, they were running infomercials in the cardio room TVs.  Where's my *Walking Dead* marathon?!  CORAL!  

I gotta admit, I was missing those ellipticals at UofM that each carried its own cable TV.  It made me wish I kept one of my old iPads to bring in my own content.  And then my music...well, it was slow and it threw my game off.  I was not dialed in like I am during the weekday.  So, I headed for the door, but not before taking away some complementary Ugly Mug Coffee.  Everything there is so tied up into my memories, isn't it?

And so I [*Walk(ed) On*](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=P3iMWI7wN1w&feature=share) from the places I have been in 2001.  On to Monday.
