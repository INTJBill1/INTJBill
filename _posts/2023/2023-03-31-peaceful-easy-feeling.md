## "Simply the Best"

I feel at peace with life.  Oh sure, I have got weight to cut, though that is more of a fun challenge. Then there is my quad/knee that remains swollen, weak and numb, but there are always those little things.  And others may say, "What's wrong with you? You should be ANGRY because the cool kids are angry!  ANGER!  ANGER!  ANGER!"  

Take a couple of steps back: it is all ridiculous, is it not?  That sort of thing drives clicks I guess.  But, anger with no tether to reality is the stuff of fools.  Anger is the foul fruit of the "you owe me" mindset.  

Today's post is entitled after another Eagles-related song and it is apt.  My old, high school truck had this covers compilation CD as a mainstay, the October '93 release, *Common Threads: The Songs of the Eagles*.

A feature I absolutely *love* about YouTube Music is for albums I like this: if it is on YouTube, I can swing it over into a playlist on the YTM side.  For whatever reason, this album is never available on streaming services; it must be a licensing thing like Garth Brooks or that [Smashing Pumpkins](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=T69Yk6IccL0&feature=share) song.

## "Thinking Problem"

I watched this the other day from Dr. Berry and was delighted this his research scientist guest shares the same take on science as I do.

And maybe that is the problem with terminal degrees: folks think they are done with learning.  The only thing that happens is that the more you know, the less you know.  There is no such thing as "follow the science" other than the pursuit of seeing how many different ways you are wrong.  This is how I went from a vegan diet to carnivore.  And the thinking schema is how I went from full-blown Arminianism to Calvinism or adding writing to a specialty in tech.
