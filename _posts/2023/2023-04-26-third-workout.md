Yes, today is my *Legs & Abs* day—well, in practice, it was a quads day.  Healing up from my *Back* day on Monday made me call an audible.  I mean, I just do not want an incline crunch on the bench when my lower back remains tight from Monday's deadlifts.

It gives me the opportunity to further rebuild this right quad, so I did squats, step-ups and leg extensions.  I burned up all 45 minutes and it was off to the gym for an hour on an elliptical followed by only 10 minutes on an arc trainer.  While I feel more "social" on the elliptical, I starting to prefer the arc trainer because that side of the gym has been playing *The Walking Dead.*

And yes, today was *supposed* to be a stationary bike day, but I do not know if it is the tiny stirrups or these shoes, but these 4E-something feet get all rattled the rest of the day when I ride that thing.  

I like my groove of going to the gym. I will say hi to folks and wave at the regulars—well, I cannot include myself into that bunch:  I have only signed up to the place 10 days ago.  But, I have recorded 6 morning workouts during that span with my Garmin. And I had a Sunday thrown into the mix where I shut things down and a morning workout is not possible anyway there.

As I have been lifting these mornings, I reflected on how I now approach it as something in the past that brings me joy, whereas in the past, it was just a means to an end, hopefully a means I could quickly get through!  But, now I see that space and find clarity.  

Sidebar: Now, I do not get as excited as Arnold does about weightlifting.  I finally got around to watching [*Pumping Iron*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lCCk6rgn84) (1977) for free on YouTube.  I did not know he is as charismatic as he is or as versed in gamesmanship. 

And this attitude of mine extends to the gym I visit.  I take a step back and smile.  It was just a little over a month when I could not even walk across the house unaided and once I did, there was no rhythm.  Just a clump-a-clump.  And look where I am today: 70 minutes of cardio today, 80 minutes yesterday and 80 minutes the day before that.  Sure, I want *more*, but when I survey, I smile.  I like the progression.

And that is the power of The Carnivore.
