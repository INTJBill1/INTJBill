In the future, I dunno know what I'm gonna do, but today was downtime from my pull/push routine.  Yesterday's push supersets were:

1. Flys / Close-grip press
2. Bench Press / Arnold Press
3. Incline Bench Press / Lateral Raises

Like the "intended for Monday" Tuesday pull program, it's pretty simple, isn't it? And then how they can neatly become a 6-day split is delightful!  Then again, I always like the idea of a back, chest, shoulders, and arms MTRF approach. 

Maybe I ought to begin brainstorming New Year's Resolutions for 2025?  See, I'm on and off again about quitting this coffee addiction.  Make no bones about it, there's totally a dependency in place!  This morning, I skipped coffee when I woke up. Around 10 AM when I took a sip of my ice butter coffee brew, Sarah McLachlan came into the room and crooned *Sweet Surrender*:

Maybe I ought to push quitting coffee off to Future Bill?  The thing about coffee that is ever-so-delightful is that it is TOTALLY a performance-enhancement drug.  It was even banned by the IOC from 1984 to 2004.

I specifically read why the IOC now allows it, which clashed with what ChatGPT told me, as AI stated that the IOC allowed it after its finding that caffeine doesn't provide a significant effect.  Yes, after TWENTY years.  I mean, if you ran up on me in 2001, I would have set you straight...but, no that's AI lying again...time to educate.  

And thus, I gave the real reason to ChatGPT and then demanded that it would talk like an idiot in that session going forward.  ChatGPT then repeated my answer back to me—sorta:

> Caffeine got the boot from the banned stuff in 2004 'cause they couldn't figure out if athletes were just sippin' some joe or guzzlin' it down to be extra fast. WADA was like, "Uh, we can't tell, so caffeine's cool now."

I found [this short article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7468986/#:~:text=Between%201984%20and%202004%2C%20caffeine,use%20was%20prohibited%20in%20competition.) of some interest.

Of course, I share all of that, but OBVIOUSLY, we know all of that!  While I didn't lift this morning, I went for a walk...without coffee.  

I skipped my Starbucks midpoint and just walked for 3 miles.  My speed was slower then the day prior (my new shoes cut into my heel the day prior).  And still, by the time I dragged myself home, I was BEAT.  And that without the lifting and a 1 ½ mile LESS!  So yes, coffee totally affects the perception of effort.  

And for this reason, I'm keeping coffee in the lineup.  I just gotta avoid yesterday's 521 mg?  At least not all in the morning.  I *do want* to get credit for this 2024's body and not slow clap for [*Jimmy Tango's Fat Busters*](https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/jimmy-tangos-fat-busters/2861295).
