The rain falls.  Cracks of earth have been the feature of my yard. How this year's crop of grass has pined for the downpour!

Simon & Garfunel's *Old Friends* 1997 compilation set fills the room with melodies of my past.  This 3-CD set served as the soundtrack to countless stories across the I-40 landscape.  How often have I taken a step back in my life and wondered if these stories are actually mine?  How often have I done that as I wrote them?

There have been others, of course, like the Counting Crows quadrumvirate of *August and Everything After* (1993), *Recovering the Satellites* (1996), *This Desert Life* (1999) and *Hard Candy* (2002).

Or the masterful Shinedown live album, *Somewhere In The Stratosphere* (2011), a reminder of my grad school past, or Vedder's *Into the Wild* (2007), a companion into Alaska. 

Recorded in January-February 1997, Foo Fighter's *Everlong* is an OST in its own 4:11 span.  In my world, February 26, 1997 was the opening of the Wolfchase Galleria.  In that era, it was the locus for so much of my life.  I had jobs at the Store of Knowledge and the World of Science (twice); friends worked at places like Johnny Rocket's, the Sunglass Hut, Stride Rite Shoes and Hallmark.  Walking around with my best friend, something new always seemed right around the corner.  *Everlong* spoke to that time.  The rhythm of the night was always *Everlong*.

And all those stores have disappeared. The people are no more.  The sound is silenced.  A part of me longs for what that was.  These days, that mall is a metaphor for everything I HATE about Memphisâ€”about *time* itself.

It is gone, but I am still *here*.
