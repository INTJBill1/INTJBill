And out of nowhere, it is spring.  Yesterday's high was 73 and we've got three days in the 70s to follow it up.  Matt gets it right:

I gotta admit: I am loving the prospect of being near parks in Bartlett.  In Memphis, I don't want to be close to one, but now, all of those *dog parks* City Planner Plays plugs in don't sound so bad.

While everything is on standby in preparation for the exodus, I look forward to diving into my fitness regimen.  It will NOT be something that only through a fist-clenched force of will do I knock it off my list.  It's gonna be something that'll be a highlight of my day. That's the thing with diet and fitness:  we seem to attach to this construct of "If I hate it, it must be awesome for me."  I don't know why we do that.  It explains kale, turnips, radishes, chards and celery.  Totally explains burpees.  Why do I need *that* skillset?  

*Plants Attempt to Murder Me*: I've developed an onion allergy or at least a heightened response to my subconscious disgust for the ones from Gordon's.  Now when I cut them up, the hand that held them will feel a bit numb for the rest of the day and as I breathe them in, the bottom of my lungs tighten up as if inflammation hits it.  My eyes water like "normal" (why do we readily accept *that*), but I can plow through that.  Maybe my younger self knew to find them disgusting! 

I LOVE my diet.  Daily bacon?  I mean, come on!  Creamy coffee?  Liver and ground beef stepped in bacon fat?  And to top it off, carbonated water in a can!  Finding ways to elevate my physical fitness levels ought to be in that spirit.  I'll be bringing something to the table that achieves that end.
