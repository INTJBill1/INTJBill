Ahh, no bread today...I think.  My DnD DM session is this afternoon, so I don't think I'll run through a romp through the kitchen...or will I?  I had planned to pause today, but, who knows?  Proactive Man!

I slept in.  Not to 3 AM.  No, this Sunday morning, I slept in to FIVE in the morning.  It felt luxurious!  *Sure beats minutes past midnight anyway.*  And yet, I felt like I was running behind.  No workouts or anything on the docket.  But, I understand how critical the morning is in shaping my day.  I recognize the value that the morning provides, that other segments of the day do not lend themselves toward mining rich content.  Don't let the moment slip away.

Sometimes the night robs the morning.  However, I only extended a late session by watching one lecture with my son from Wonderium's  30-episode [*World War II: A Military and Social History*](https://www.wondrium.com/thomas-childers).  It is a fantastic series.  It is not my first run through the courses, as I recall grabbing the audio version to listen in the car [down to West Monroe in 2019](https://duckcommander.com/pages/visit-us).  

I get a taste of that camo'd space in Louisiana every time I visit the Bass Pro Shop at the Pyramid.  Perhaps it is a glimpse inside my alternate timeline.

It's funny: the older I get, the more I wish I chose an analog life over this digital outcome.  I was rare in those days.  Today, Apple markets a pair of silly VR goggles for 3500 bucks—sorry, "spatial computing" goggles.  Honestly, I'd find more value in how to clean a duck and skin a buck.  I thought more about power grids when I lived in Alaska, but it has always been in the back of my head.

Lately, I've had a hankering for hobbies.  Like, to learn something new...or to build a model of something.  One thing that hit me the other day was how could would it be if I had a real to-scale train running through the house, like a track with tunnels through the drywall?  Not now, of course.  Maybe that's something in my 15-year bucket.

I have been reticent about learning something new—well, buying into learning about something new.  The thing is, that's a lost opportunity—whatever it was.  I have resurrected my interest in baking bread.  It was really something I did (poorly) on a whim one day in Alaska.  There's really nothing to it, but I am glad I've got that stashed away in my toolbox.  

What else is out there?
