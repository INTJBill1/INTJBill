## Prologue

I shake off the vestiges of slumber and hurry down the hallway.  I scowl at my watch; I slept in to 3 AM's alarm.  Time runs through my fingers and down my arms.

## Scene 1

Applying my electric kettle, I boil water, adding it and 12 tbsps of butter to my Vitamix.  While blending at a quarter speed in stealth, I add the refrigerated ~20 oz of coffee I had brewed the night prior.  I pour that atop a half-iced Yeti.  He growls in acquiescence.

Instantly, I take a big swig from the stein and feel the rush to my veins.

## Scene 2

I set my phone to run through Matthew Colville's *Running the Game*.  I find his discussion of adding politics to Dungeons & Dragons to be thought-provoking.  I like his drawing of comparisons between the Civil War, the Cold War and the original *Battlestar Galactica*.

## Scene 3

Now that I have got my brew at hand and my lectures for the morning, I run through my morning campaignâ€”things like clearing the dishwasher so that I can clean as I go with my baking; or another: run a load of clothes so that I can use the warm surface of the clothes dryer to incubate the dough.

I engage in encounters that are bread-centric...well, there is that crockpot of beans that is to be seasoned and then unplugged to coast to the finish line.

It is only a minor setback.  I return to the focus of forming bread.

## Scene 4

It is nearly 4 AM.  I have a moment to lift in the garage.  Training in a furystorm, I feel rushed; I do not have enough time.  I cannot finish my new resistance routine.  After 3 supersets, my timer pops up. 

I have to return to crafting bread.  

I chuckle as I consider that I have never seen that play out at the gym.  "Must be the carbs!"

## Scene 5

After forming the loaf, I re-emerge in the garage to commence my traning.  But, I fail to finish that last superset. 

I am all Bruce Banner: I cannot get keyed up again to power through my routine as The Hulk.  

I feel weak from the prior thirty sets to finish these final, ten dumbbell sets.  I must shelve this incline bench with its Arnold press mate, a combination that is accented by crunches.

## Scene 6

I checkmark the daily task of kicking off the pool filter before sunrise.  I return inside and build my carnivore meal for the day, another day toward something I cannot see.

The oven timer rings out.
