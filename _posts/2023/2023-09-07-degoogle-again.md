Logging into my Gmail this morning, I received this *ominous* warning from the client:

*You could lose access to your 7 years of Gmail history.*

"Wow there, Bucko, I only have emails as old as March.  I guess YOU still have everything else." 

And isn't it *peculiar* to add an email address to my email address?  

I am moving away from Google Music.  But, I am not the only that is flippant with tech.  A painful website I like to visit from time to time is [Killed By Google](https://killedbygoogle.com/).  

So many memories...heartaches...remember that time we could have our own custom home page with iGoogle?  A few Google products deserved their death knell, like Google Buzz and Google+... 

...but Google Reader did not!  I still ache for it; the #1 feed readerâ€”*just gone*!

The only thing I see sticking around with Google is its search and YouTube, two things that drive ads.  Again, Google is an advertising company.  That's it. 

And sure, other companies can and do shutter their doors.  In grad school, I listened to a LOT of rdio.com ([*Entertainment Weekly* bit](https://web.archive.org/web/20141110200751/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20663844,00.html)).  Juggernauts like Myspace fall to the wayside.  But, Google has and *absolutely* will pull the rug out from beneath its users.  You can bet your bottom dollar they will.

Ultimately, Google's behavior reinforces my idea to depend far less on its ecosystem.  Here today, shuttered tomorrow.  Will these services I lean on be there a year from now?  Here are the services in order of need for me:

1. **Drive / One** - *Cloud backups that are accessible by strange admins.*
1. **Gmail** - *Read my email, please!*
1. **Docs/Sheets/Slides** - *(See above)*
1. **Android phone** - *I'm ready for a dumb phone.  Bottom of the barrel, licking lead paint kind of dumb.* 
1. **YouTube** - *Giving this up would be "super easy, barely an inconvenience."*
1. **Chromecast** - *Running an HDMI cord from a laptop is...tacky?*
1. **YouTube Music** - *Would be ranked higher, if I cared to stream my collection of...GARTH BROOKS' CDs!*
1. **Calendar** - *This is really important to me until I forget it exists.*
1. **bookmarks sync** - *How else am I gonna cart around that video of [The Nine Most Terrifying Words in the English Lanaguage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhYJS80MgYA)?*
1. **Chrome** - *I liked the jump I made from Navigator to IE; I LOVED the hop from IE to Firefox; I swooned over the leap from Firefox to Chrome; and today?*
1. **Contacts** - *"And the price of a memory is the memory of the sorrow it brings"*
1. **Find My Device** - *I'm forever misplacing my phone.*
1. **Photos** - *This thing just happened to me.*
1. **Forms** - *"...while your computer's crashin', mine's multitaskin'"*
1. **Fonts** - *Dreaming in ITC Benguiat.  Living in [Papyrus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVhlJNJopOQ).*
1. **Maps** - *Half of my life's stories don't happen WITH this.*

Clearly, like the hegemony of foreign oil, gotta remove my dependence on Google...
