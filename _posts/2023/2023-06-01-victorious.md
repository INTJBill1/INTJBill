## History

It is June 1, 2023! It is the OFFICIAL start of summer (c'mon, June ain't spring).

If this was 2019 as I gearing up for *STRANGER THINGS 3*, I would have just kicked off *The Lost 7th Expedition* after a 190 days freefall up the scale. There would be six weeks of new wave music and then a tie the most weight lost in an Expedition (43 lbs).

 I gaze back on 2020's June 1, the genesis for what I am doing now.  After completing Taubes' *The Case Against Sugar* on that day,  I wrote this in my return from the wasteland:

> My basic strategy is to reduce sugars thereby not requiring as much insulin which in turn, doesn't get in the way of hormones for resource allocation. While I have my base level of meals to make sure I capture maximum nutrition, I'm not so hardcore calorie-centric. This is especially notable as in these early stages, if I'm hungry beyond my meal plan, I have the freedom to eat 6 oz of beans or whatever. This softer stance has kept the binges at bay.

At its core, that is what I do to this day.  That disregard for calories was a fundamental shift, but absolutely critical was the sugar/carb approach.  I only wish I did not regard protein so highly back then and downplayed fatâ€”it was standard for me to eat 150 grams of protein a day.  Gluconeogenesis from the excess protein would nip me at me from January to July 2021.

But the biggest takeaway is that this was the moment I was unlocking the secret to massive, sustainable weightloss. 

## Site Design

I am abandoning my retrowave theme for this site.  Oh, I am ready to drop it in!  Those colors pop!  The synthwave idea works well for base level content, the birdcage liner stuff that I have a tendency to post.  But when it comes to serious topics, it is a little silly.  

## Brainstorm

This morning was a good 3 AM.  My mind whirled about with ideas!

1. In this season, remember 2020: stop following the news.  What has it anything to do with me?  I have got plenty to do besides shaking my head at folks.  That includes piecing together the news from my beloved *The Babylon Bee.*
2. Create an achievement system based on Garmin / World of Warcraft.
3. Create a daily checkoff sheet that functions like my resistance sheet.
4. Create a DnD-inspired task management system that through the use of metaphor would be shaped by dice rolls to create a story.
5. Create a simpler I/O budget system that would do a better job at sharing the narrative for the month.  Many budgets fail to address the why.
6. Instead of an audiobook focus, use a targeted Wonderium coursework approach.
7. Be the Mindmap Monster!
