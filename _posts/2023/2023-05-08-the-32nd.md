The results are in...I lost:

<p style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold;text-align: center">12.5 lbs.</p>

Since November, it tallies up to a weightloss of 67 lbs.

This is the first time, the very first time including my low-calorie shenanigans, that I have had a double-digit weightloss for 4 consecutive Expeditions.

With a target of 200+/75, I did it on daily averages of these macros

* **Fat**: 220.7 grams
* **Protein**: 79.8 grams
* **Carbs**: whatever nonsense 2 eggs a day nets me

I fulfilled it with the following cooked amounts:

* Bacon: 8.5 lbs
* Butter: 16.6 lbs
* Coffee: 4.1 gallons
* Bacon Drippings: 3.6 cups
* Ground Beef: 9.3 lbs
* Eggs: 82 Large
* Prosciutto: 1.4 lbs
* Ribeye: 0.4 lbs
* Chicken Wings: 1.8 lbs
* Gelatin: 1 pack
* Pork Ribs: 0.2 lbs

There is plenty of work ahead.  [As detailed with my Fitness page](/fitness/#competition-the-ketocarnivore-vs-hfc), I have completed competing with the Keto segment of my past.  On to 2020's take on Carnivore.
