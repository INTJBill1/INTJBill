Last morning, as I extended my morning beyond 3 AM kneading together another loaf of bread, YouTube Music gave me a heads up that it had a playlist rendered for me:  [Spring Recap '23](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=LRSRyt6XihGhUqs8oDVM1v5InKY68AOHd9lUy&feature=share)

It is a bit more varied than the adventure that was [Winter Recap '23](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=LRSRgPZAoJXVnkWSuw5hsYPQGpjdrzSYaYOl3&feature=share), although I gotta tell ya, with this beard I started on May 15, I'll be joining a band of Dwarves for adventuring through this winter.

I am reminded how this spring did not reflect the promise of winter.  Don't get me wrong, there was some good stuff in thereâ€”the move and everything.  But, it really falls flat from the story I want to tell. 

To some extent, the way I set aside my New Year's resolutions list may explain my discontent.  

Back in May, I chose to bring to the forefront what I want this year to achieve, like the elusive Yeard, an all-out, societal-dictates-be-damned approach to who I was meant to be.  On that day as I did for New Year's Eve, I shaved both face and scalp to begin again.  Everything with me is symbolic; I check the mail and it's dripping with subtext.  So it was on that day.

I have reworked my New Year's Resolutions: [Destination '23](/destination/) for a July kickoff.  I've got my teeth sunk in those, don't I?  Or, a Rick Astley fascination!
