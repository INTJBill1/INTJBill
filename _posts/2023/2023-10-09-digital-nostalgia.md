In my return to Google, I thought I'd settle with its toolbox.  And yet, where do I find myself:  on my Linux box, using Brave and composing in Visual Studio Code.  I do have [Lux](https://lux-ambient.bandcamp.com/) playing in the background via a YouTube stream so I'm not wholly apart from Google.  *And still...*

The rest can be associated to a memoryâ€”some the entire album, others particular tracks.  

My heart drops to some...surges for others...

With this nostalgia of these past days, I must do what is found on a U2 album: I gotta [*Walk On*](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=P3iMWI7wN1w&si=2IUGisI4aMG68X-6).
