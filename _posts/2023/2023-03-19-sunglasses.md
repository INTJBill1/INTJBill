## Discipline

> Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge,   
but one who hates correction is <mark>stupid.</mark>
>
> Proverbs 12:1, HCSB

It is another day of stiff, stubborn and swollen pain for my right knee/quads.  It is disheartening.  I have not checked the scale, even to see if it still works after a computer display came crashing down on it during the move, but I do know that I am likely not dropping weight with this much inflammation going on.  Then again, I recognize that increased insulin is the primary driver to weight gain.

I woke up at 11:44 PM and bested my alarm by waking up again at 2:45 AM to start my day reading John MacArthur's commentary of the Gospel of John while in an Epsom salt soak—a Dr. Teal's Black Elderberry.

When I get injured like this, I have found that it is a good reminder for some self-reflection in terms of the big picture, that is, regarding the Eternity that is before me.  Now, I have noticed that my loving Father corrects me specifically in this manner.  There are other tools in his tool chest, but He tends to get my immediate attention when He lovingly shuts me down.  Is this an opportune time for correction to *me*?  Hardly—I have got things to do!  We just moved into a new place—organization and projects!  But, my Father is the master of time.  So, I trust that *even* this is good.  I find this passage of scripture to be the template for life:

> Trust in the LORD with all your heart,     
and do not rely on your own understanding;   
think about Him in all your ways,   
and He will guide you on the right paths.  
Don't consider yourself to be wise;   
fear the LORD and turn away from evil.   
This will be healing for your body  
and strengthening for your bones.   
Honor the LORD with your possessions   
and with the first produce of your entire harvest;   
then your barns will be completely filled,    
and your vats will overflow with new wine.   
Do not despise the LORD's instruction, my son,   
and do not loathe His discipline;   
<mark>for the LORD disciplines the one He loves,</mark>      
<mark>just as a father, the son he delights in. </mark>

> Proverbs 3:5-12, HCSB

## Temptation

My sweet wife brought home a six-pack of Guinness, my favorite beer.  She also got cherry cheesecake ice cream; ingredients for nachos; and some Little Debbie's Nutty Buddies and Strawberry Shortcake Rolls; it is a tossup as to which one is my favorite.  Now, if those delights were offered before me this morning, I would have given in.  Anything to numb the pain, right?  It is why I screwed up and broke my carnivore streak on August 22, a tailspin that I could not recover from until November 22. I regretted breaking that 637-day streak more than all of the weight gain.

No, I could not snap this 118-day-and-counting streak.  No, inside of me, there is a [fire](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=_ub0Wm8UMko&feature=share).  

I'm gonna keep my 87% fat / 13% protein day.  I was fortunate I watched Dr. Berry's Q/A earlier:
