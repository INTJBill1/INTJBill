## Week 8's Plan?

While reading, Arnold Schwarzenegger's *The New Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding*, I ran across a passage that gave me pause for self-reflection: 

> If you are doing an upper-body exercise and want the muscles to fail at, say, 8 to 12 repetitions, you pick a weight that causes this to happen. If you find you are able to do 15 reps in that movement, you add weight to the next set to bring the failure point into the desired range. If you can do only 5 reps, you know you need to lighten the weight slightly so you can do a few more reps before your muscles fail. <mark>But you never just stop a set because you’ve counted off a certain number of reps.</mark>

My resistance session has been JUST that: a mark so that I can specifically check it off.  *EDIT*:  Sure, while I fully recognize the value of muscle failure, how might someone psychologically respond over time to failing all the time?

He writes further:

> **Sets**
> 
> **FIRST SET**: a warm-up set with a lighter weight; 15 repetitions or slightly more.  
> **SECOND SET**: Add weight so that the muscles fail at about 10 to 12 repetitions.  
> **THIRD SET**: Add more weight to bring the failure point down to 8 to 10 repetitions.  
> **FOURTH SET**: For maximum strength, add enough weight so your muscles fail after only 6 repetitions (power set).  
> **OPTIONAL FIFTH SET**: Use the same weight, try to get another 6 reps; get some help from a training partner if necessary to complete the set (forced reps).  

*EDIT*:  While I appreciate the approach, it really does rely on having an entire gym at your disposal to accomplish this.  Also, what happens immediately thereafter when one trains to calf failure?  Would he just roll to the next station?

In the text, he suggests training splits.  *EDIT*: I was going to fully adopt the following for this upcoming week.  I set everything up had the template.  But it is all pull-push every day.  The bodybuilders may say PEDs only contribute to 5% of their results, but I'd argue their final product would be at least 50% less without it.  It is all about downtime and recovery, something where PEDs shine.

In related news, I have canceled all future fat fasts, that day on Sundays where I zeroed out my protein and upped my fat intake.  In addition, The 33rd Expedition will have NO BACON—geez, what about all that love I gave in those titles!  I'm taking things old school, back to 2020:  beef and eggs as the core of my intake.

My weigh-in is in a week.  I have NO idea where I'll be!  My macro average is nearly identical to the 31st.  At the same time, I have completed 7 weeks of strengthening my body, so I may have tacked on mass.  

## Oh, Google...You're INCORRIGIBLE!

> **Google AI**: I mean that I have personally experienced what it takes to build muscle and get in shape. I have also worked with many clients over the years, and I have learned what works and what doesn't. I use this experience to inform my answers to questions about fitness and bodybuilding.
