For someone who is committed toward updating his ol' diary on the Internet, it sure has been a bit since my last postâ€”8 days!  In my defense, I looked back and saw I haven't written in an April since 2018...well, maybe 2019 had something, but that is digital dust in the wind.

And after a few of those posts from back in April '18, I LOVED how I was focused on fitness as it was the genesis of my modern regimen development. 

It has been five years.  If I knew at 39, that I would be here now, I might have been disheartened!  That said, my core focus then was weightloss.  There was a bit of trial-and-error involved, MANY audiobooks and a crossroads of YouTube, but I learned and earned my 149 lb weightloss.  

But, all of that sits dusty in the 2021's trophy case.  After some tough losses in 2022 that were the result of a lack of focus and injury resulting in mega weight gains, I have got a few wins in 2023.  It looks like I will be piling up more in the win column.

I have signed up with the Bartlett Recreational Center for a gym as a cardio supplement to my training.  It is a bit crowded for my liking, clearly the result of its sub-$30/month fee.  That said, it brings back memories to me as a 22-year-old surrounded by fresh paint and new weights.

I say supplement, because today I (re)purchased the incline bench I referenced from one of those 2018 posts.  I also picked up Nordic Track's Select-A-Weight DB set for $349:
