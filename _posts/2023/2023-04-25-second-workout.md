Since I stripped out the VR warmup at ~3:30 AM in the pursuit of morning optimization, I was ready to utilize the weights I referenced yesterday, that NordicTrack Select-a-Weight 55lb set right at 4AM.  Yes, Amazon failed me (again); and I'm reminded to source things locally or if I must, go to a different online vendor.

I finished my first hour of cardio on the elliptical and moved on to the arc trainer when I finally overtook him.  And yes, for a brief ten minutes, I was alone:

As I left the gym, I found myself dancing to this Star Lord's tune:
