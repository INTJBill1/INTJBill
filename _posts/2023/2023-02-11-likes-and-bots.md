## Album of the Day

## Virtual Idiosyncrasy

Later today, I'll be migrating my Tutanota email address back to Google, swinging by sites and updating as needed.  Not moving old emails—that's for sure!  Before leaving Facebook for the last time, I handed out my updated email to those who I've been doing PM exchanges (well, I forgot one).  I have not received a single email.  Not one!  I mean, I had multiple threads ongoing—active dialog on Facebook!  Pull it from that FB notification ding...folks don't engage.  Are they all merely cleverly crafted pieces of code by ol' Zuckerberg?  

If we just smacked the tennis ball to one another a couple of times, I totally would get that.  That said, my leap off Facebook is just switching a phone number...though, I guess folks don't do that anymore, either.

I find it a delightful curiosity of the system.  The platform is too cluttered, too generated these days.  I find peace leaving it, though...it's bittersweet.  It's never easy when I leave this or that individual behind.  Collectively, sure—"See ya, cloud crowd!"  But walking away from a person who is a unique, complex spirit...yeah, it's a hard one.  And multiply that sensation by N number of times!  And then there's the recognition that maybe they are just...*indifferent*.  Worst yet, perhaps [Facebook relegates our soul to this?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg7UGh1GqA0)

I'm reminded of these lyrics:

> I changed by not changing at all  
Small town predicts my fate  
Perhaps that's what no one wants to see  
I just want to scream hello  
>
> -Pearl Jam, *[Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=2jcp8X-OnFg&feature=share)*

I suppose time is not the same for me as my Cylon brethren.  Beyond the stories and toe stubs along the way, I'm no different today as I approach 45 than when I was coming upon 25...

...I don't know...I'll continue to champion the value of NOT keeping up with the news; it's all a bunch of marketing anyway: "Join our Party today and gnash teeth together!"  Worse still..."Be like us teens!  Say our words!  Wear our clothes!  Listen to our music!  Because we matter!  You DON'T."  Naw, I rather pull up a chair and listen to the old fellas drinking their morning coffee  

Stay away from the rhetoric of the cool kids' table.  Cuddle up with a good history book.  Or when you get that need to pop open that news feed, just read about the Ardennes offensive...or *Uncommon Grounds: The History of Coffee and How It Transformed Our World*.  

## Fitness

I watched the following video last night of a man in his 50s talking to a 44-year-old.  While not a carnivore-centric video, I loved its approach to fitness, that if we know something is superior, why rely on a metric for validation?  Just trust the process, right?  And it also compelled me to leave 2022 in the past and work out!  Yes, I can lose weight and not lift a single dumbbell on carnivore, but that just resets me.  What if I want to be *more*?  What if I want to *win*?

The video highlights this article, *[The Health Benefits of Resistance Exercise: Beyond Hypertrophy and Big Weights](https://journals.lww.com/acsm-esm/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=2023&issue=01000&article=00002&type=Fulltext)*.
