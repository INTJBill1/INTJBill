## Beverages

I am now on Day 6 of my coffee detox.  I took NO ibuprofen yesterday because I only experienced a limited amount of aching in my calves.  Ibuprofen was just a stopgap measure so that I was not distracted from doing...well, ANYTHING.  I am on my third day of an unexplained neck tightness on the toward the back-right quadrant, but who knows?  Maybe instead of coffee detox, it is from awkward sleep?  Regardless, it is fair to say that on my sixth day, I am out of the woods with my coffee depoisoning.  I feel the benefits of being coffee-free.  

Fun fact:  I can totally pack an iced YETI tumbler into a moving box.

## Destination '23 Finalized

I have chosen the objectives that I am going to roll with for 2023.  And it is only halfway into the third month of the new year, too!  Somebody pat me on the back!  Ah...again, we put three (technically four) offers on houses this year; my mind has been preoccupied.  The list is not too far of a reach to attain.  Lose 110 lbs?  Done it before.  Learn code?  Done it before.  Learn Koine Greek?  Totally shaky!  

I have revised the list to ensure there are only three points under every heading.  I removed the year-long, Cities Skylines city; theology book of the month; 250 audiobooks; and deleted the daily study of physical disciples in lieu of a two-day-a-week for Python and Greek.  

I also cleaned up the Software Standards for legibility and removed my social media initiatives.  I removed the Garmin step-count / challenges requirements because I am not focused on making a website happy;  I am better served by a better balanced routineâ€“even one tilting toward resistance!  Of course, the effect of removing that req is how the 250-audiobook resolution goes up in flames.

Is it unrealistic to hit all of my marks?  The year is already almost a quarter over.  It is an issue of time discipline and optimization while mitigating the impact of constraints in the system.  It can be done. I may have sat in a class or two on production operations management.
