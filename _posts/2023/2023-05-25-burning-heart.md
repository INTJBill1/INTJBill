Yesterday, I picked up a Garmin badge I wanted for a couple of weeks now:

> **Run the Star Wars Galaxy** - *Join this Disney 100 Years of Wonder challenge and record 100 minutes of running activities in May.*

I did the first 71 minutes at the gym and was unsure if I would finish the remaining 29 minutes since I am moving away from running to mitigate risk. I "ran" non-stop in the pool yesterday as fast as I could.  It's funny:  it didn't seem like a hard workout as I only felt pain a handful of times, but I came away from it WEARY for a good time thereafter.  "But, I didn't do ANYTHING!"

It was a good time for audiobook listening as I'm closing out on a 35-hour text. 

This morning, I picked up another Garmin badge that I sighted months ago and finally picked up May's version:

> **May Step Month** - *Join this challenge and record 300,000 steps in May.*

Yeah, this challenge was something that came out of my New Year's Resolutions.  While I missed out on each of the first four months, I am ecstatic that I am now in position to complete each month for the rest of the year.  In the same vein, while missing on the first quarter, I am glad that I am now on my way to completing the second segment of the 365-mile yearlong challenge.

The challenge this week is how to shake this dreadful weariness. Even during my lifting this morning, I found myself sitting on the bench after my Arnold presses, instead of immediately popping up after each set.  Maybe cutting from 12 to 10 tbsps of butter in the morning was a mistake?  I wanted to hold 2 in reserve for a fun, mid-day drink.
