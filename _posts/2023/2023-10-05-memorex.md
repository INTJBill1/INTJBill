It was a fun run. With some hesitancy, I login into a digital dystopia; I am back on Google.  As much as I'd like to do my own thing, I recognize the value of sharing, version control and product integration.  it's not about me; this is a bladerunner world.   

Years ago, I set aside my IT aspirations; why am I spending so much time with tech?  There's no application other than for my personal funzies.  I've got a lot of projects in my head that never get off the ground because I'm working these wrenches.  Again, I gotta spend less time with my tools and more time with my wizardry.

Along the way, I discovered a few streams on YouTube:

* [The Best of Norway's Railway Cab Views](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7CJ3pm-e7s) - *"oh my heart"*
* [Blade Runner Radio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7HjY5-of2c)
* [Softest Radio Stream - Chillout Playlist for Calm Productivity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FD5ugnM0pQ)

I journey through a quiet landscape.  I suppose I'm an outsider...

## @ 277 Lbs & 277 Days

Wasn't it just the other day I was 269 lbs?  Is July's 213 so long ago?

If I am like everybody else, I'm back to being that 336 lb guy in the workshop...  

...if I was like everybody else, I'd hand over something shiny to the village's medicine man so that would work his voodoo for that vision quest.

However...I know the way out; after all, I am an *outsider*.  Eat healthy: eat beef, bacon, butter and eggs.  

However, it's more than thatâ€”there is a visualization that goes on for seeing the future requires a vision...  

277 days remain at 45.  At a BMI of 40.03, what shall be done with them?

> It's funny how life turns out  
The odds of faith in the face of doubt  
Camera One closes in  
The soundtrack starts  
The scene begins  
You're playing you now
