## Builds

I've rolled out a massive update to my site with a new content section.  It hosts my major and side projects, the aptly-named [Builds](/builds/). It spans *Current Builds*, *Future Builds* and in time, *Past Builds*.

Within the *Current Builds* section, there are four projects in place that link to content:

1. Hagiasmos
2. Homeschool
3. HFC, Phase I
4. Chief Workbench

My intent is that I update each build with pictures/content and progress as appropriate.  Musings on future builds remain in-house. 

On *HFC, Phase I*, I'm delighted to bring back the countdown weigh-in AND something new and in line with my pursuit to beat out, [a chart](/builds/hfc-phase1/#ketocarnivore-vs-hfc) comparing my keto/carnivore weightloss and my current high-fat carnivore drive.


## What I Do at McDonald's

I've done this very same thing at McDonald's for awhile now:

[Dr. Ken Berry: *What I Order at @McDonalds*](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/C0UBBHM2c_M)

In the past, I rode with 4 patties, but in today's moderate protein context of 75 grams (assuming a cooked weight of 3 oz for the 4.2 oz pre-cooked), I might dial that down to 2 to 3 units (67 to 89 grams of protein).
