I have yet to transform this site, but this favorite album above is a prompting of the past while pointing to the future.  I feel *vibrant*. I have been surprised as to how *alive* I feel in my mornings, more so than any other part of the day.  I dream.  I am who I want to be.  So often, folks look down the road and what they want.  I am what I want.

I rolled out my *Arms* routine this morning.  Again, there never was enough time with this 5x15 schema. This was on my plate:

* DB Curls
* DB Hammer Curls
* DB Lying Triceps Extensions

I whiffed on attempting DB Triceps Extensions, not that my triceps could not do the weight I once did, but my elbow was doing this popping thing.  It did not hurt, however.  Yet, it was concerning, a souvenir from that pre-dawn run back in 2022 as I evaded that zombie.  Thus, I shifted to extensions on the bench.  It was also a reminder that this resistance workout is more than just for toning, but strengthens ligaments and builds bone mass.  Sure, those and just the general hypertrophy will take away from my success on the scale, but I am totally OK with that!  I am already seeing performance gains on the elliptical, just two weeks into my cardio approach.  

I hit the door at 4:45 AM and settled into my cardio at the gym at 5 AM.  I put in...

* 32 minutes on the elliptical
* 31 on the arc trainer, including an ending that really worked over my quads
* 7 min cooldown on the indoor track

Finally, I ended with maybe 5 minutes on the spin bike.  I set the height to 11, though I might set it to  12 in the future.  I do not know the spinning way of doing things; I just know the best approach when I commuted to work to generate power coming out of a stop light.  Observation: why are there so many short people on spin bikes?  Oh yeah, because they weigh nothing!  

So, I pulled my upper 220's(?) frame atop and did the whole pedaling thing, on and out of the saddleâ€”I could do it!  But, my tank had the low fuel light pop on.  I do not know if it was because of my prior workout with its quad focus, my legs day on Wednesday, my weight or just at the outset of my fitness so that my stamina sucks, but I do not know if I could go the distance for a class.  I dunno, throw some Def Leppard on...some KISS...hey, some DISCO, and..."I'm your huckleberry."

That said, I would rather set it as a target once I am sub-200.  It is right around the corner and I would welcome the challenge after 12 weeks of these 6 days-a-week workouts.  Honestly, there is a part of me that would invite adding my own spin class each week.  

I am amused at the impact I have had on the gym.  The bucket at the back of the cardio room for the wipes is off-kilter with a bent leg because of me.  And on the indoor track upstairs, the wet floor warning sign is on the far side is my doing.
