## Builds With Wood: The Queue

My build queue is filling up fast!  Perhaps a strategy to employ is how I did in 2003 with 3 credit cards: knock out in ascending order...well, I first GOTTA  build a proper workbench—I cry a little on the inside that I gave my ol' tank to my neighbor.  You could hit that thing with a truck and it's now time to buy a new grill.

For now, I'm researching ideas/techniques  I like.  It's been 5-6 years since I've pulled off my last woodworking build so some of it is clearing a path to that door in my head.  Immediately, I'm reminded of how pretentious the genre is.  Admittedly, there's a...a wistful part of me that likes the handsaws.  No noise, no risk...almost a Zen quality to it all.  But, a wood router, yo;  that's gotta be my favorite.  Still, there are others who think a table saw is required for any build.  I've always just used a circular saw with jigs.  Seems like a safer approach.  

I'm ever-aware of tool creep.  It works like scope creep, but it's FAR more insidious because...let's face it:  tools are cool.

Woodworking is just this:

* Plan
* Acquire material
* Make cuts
* Join
* Sand
* Finish

## Builds With Tech: This Website

The other day, I nearly abandoned this Jekyll approach to adopt WordPress.  OK, so I DID for a few hours.  I exported all 600-whatever posts into a single XML to pop into WordPress.  It was live, I was doing it—"What are you doing, Bill?"  

Incidentally, I wiped out the live version of my Jekyll site with I made the switch to a dynamic/database one.  It's not particularly problematic as I now keep zipped-up manual backups.  But, sometimes I miss little pieces of code.  FORTUNATELY, I have a development version that I was tooling around with and hence this iteration.  It's kinda up?  I've got features I wanted to roll out, but they're not ready.

And I'm still thinking I need a retrowave theme.  Oh, I'm not going to serve up that classic one I did for years.  I like it—well, love it, but this is something new...sorta.  OK, it'll be in the lineage of the prior theme!

Admittedly, I have a hard time pulling away from just a clean website with readable fonts.  Still, I backed away from a simple CSS site, so I suppose it's time to move on.  And frankly, no one cares about a simple CSS!
