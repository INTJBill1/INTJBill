## This Expedition

I FINALLY have the title for this Expedition: *The 32nd Expedition: On This Day*.  The following song is today's addition to its playlist:  Fireflight, [*Unbreakable*](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=I2WcMxlXAx0&feature=share)

It has been a week since *Dust in the Bin*.  It has been an emotional week as evidenced by my protein macros:

* Thu: 144
* <mark>Fri: 56</mark>
* Sat: 130
* Sun: 78
* Mon: 169
* Tue: 70
* Wed: 115
* Thu: 76
* Fri: So far, I am satisfied with this morning's 58.

I did not plan that rhythm; I just ate what my body felt.  And my body totally flipped on autopilot and applied metabolic confusion.

## Training

I am proud that I completed Week 6, hitting everything that I had planned to do (and notched up the weights on some exercises).  I can already see flashes of toning.  The great thing about my high-fat diet is that my body already burns fat for fuel and as there are no carbs flipping on the insulin rages, fat keeps burning off, which hopefully provides for a future showcase! 

Historically, I've *never* chosen resistance as the primary driver of my fitness sessions. 

On to Week 7!

## Inspiration

I don't know how many documentaries an MMA fighter needs as I have already seen Conor McGregor's *Notorious*...

...but I have been inspired this week by his *McGregor Forever* mini-series on Netflix:

How do we respond when we don't win?  When we do fail?  I'm reminded of this line from *Rocky Balboa*: 

> The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows.  It is a very mean and nasty place and it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't how hard you hit; <mark>it's about how hard you can get hit, and keep moving forward.</mark> How much you can take, and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done.
