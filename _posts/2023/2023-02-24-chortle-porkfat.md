## Wheelin' and Dealin' Just Ain't My Thing

Last night, we submitted our revised offer to the seller for the *Kathleen Kelly* that places $30k in an escrow for repairs or we'll "touched down in the land of the Delta Blues."  Experientially, I'm at a unique place.  I'll be happy when I get the place; I'll be happy when I walk.  In the end, "All I do is win, win, win, no matter what."

Do I think the deal will actually happen?  Not likely.  I get the sense that many of the houses that have remained on the market for 100 days have a seller who thinks the 2021-2022 housing windfall will hit them and they can swim in their new gold like Scrooge McDuck.  The thing is, prices are dropping—and that's BEFORE the Reckoning that's a'comin'.  

And on the flip side, we can quickly pivot: if we put an offer in on a new place, we could close a week later than this current closing date.

## Sketchup

Some years ago, I resisted moving to Sketchup's online app.  I'd just run down the 2017 desktop version and install it on my platform.  Plus, there's a temptation just to sketch something down on paper and wing it.  Well, in my return to creating things, I really do like the online space.  Knowing the keyboard shortcuts is helpful.  I created a mockup of the workbench I've created and will create just so that I could re-acquaint myself.  I didn't break it down to the dowel/rabbet level, but just a general sense.  I hate that it shows feet, but I didn't default it to inches until after I created the file (apparently it cannot be switched mid-drawing).

And, no, I didn't create that guy other than scaling him 5'9—And I'd never wear a dinosaur shirt!  However, my holding a ukulele/mandolin...

Oh, who am I kidding: I'd totally wear a shirt with a Hasselhoff riding a dinoaur at the end of [this *True Survivor* music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTidn2dBYbY).
