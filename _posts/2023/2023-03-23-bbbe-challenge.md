I have shifted to Dr. Berry's BBBE Challenge.  Bacon, beef, butter and eggs...or butter, bacon, beef and eggs...or...well, I really do not know what the order is!  In practice, I am just adding a couple of eggs into my routine—well, my WIFE has been doing a wonderful job pulling it all together.  She is a better cook than me; I tend to just make the temps right and wolf it down so that I can focus my attention elsewhere.

* Bacon, a half package of bacon (cooked range of 2-4 oz)
* Ground beef, a pre-cooked half lb of  (~5oz)
* Butter, 12 tbsp
* Eggs, 2 Large

It is a burger patty with a cross-hatched layer of bacon in an egg soft taco. The remaining bacon is on the side.  I wash it all down with unsalted butter melted into boiling water poured over ice.  This drink can come off tasting like cheesecake.  Everything is salted to taste.  Sidebar:  I have not returned to my homemade ghee since we moved for it remains in the cabinet. 

I have been eating that in the morning around 7 and I am good for the rest of the day with a few cans of my bubbily water along the way.

So, it is NOT a challenge—it is DELIGHTFUL!  The weight is falling off of me and I am having buckets of fun while I am doing it.  My only regret is that I was not a carnivore in 1996 as I wound up winding down my time in high school.  College would have been wholly different.  And I would have changed my parents' lives.  

Now, I reached the conclusion that calories don't amount to JACK SQUAT...

...and learned that fat is an organ regulating the body's hormones. 

I also like Dr. Berry's take on it as well:

In my own application, I went one Expedition averaging 3000 kcal a day and worked out 2 hours a day and dropped substantial weight.  I went another Expedition averaging 1900 kcal and that same 2 hours:  after that set of six weeks, I lost *1* lb.  One pound!  Yeah, I confirmed right THEN that the whole *calories in-out* gimmick was by folks who have NOT *walked-the-walk*.
