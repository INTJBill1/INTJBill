This approach of becoming the best version of me has got me exhausted!  My leaving of my coffee addiction—and make no mistake, that is what it is—that last vestige of the fat life I left behind, imparts one last shot at me.  In past attempts in suffering through withdrawal from that drug, I had monster headaches.  This time, while they were out on the horizon, these 200 grams of fat must have mitigated their approach.  HOWEVER, what I cannot shake in these two days is insurmountable drowsiness in my mornings.  Sure, at my standard 3:30-6:30 AM, I was rockin'.  But 9 AM might as well have been 1 AM.  Come to think of it, it is WORSE—I woke up on my own at 12:45 AM and was ready to start my day.  

One of the other symptoms of my withdrawal is lower back tightness/discomfort—I did not even know that was a thing from coffee!  It is reminiscent of the times I would fast for an extended period of time.  I did not feel it the first day, but the second...boy howdy.  Just a general achy feeling all around.

It is *hard* for I understand the emotional history I have had with coffee since that spring weekend of '99.  It is not just another beverage.  If it was not coffee, it was loose-leaf tea.  Harder still, is to know that I will not be going back.  And as I write, this well-time Kalax song plays:

I am evolving...no, I am *restoring*.  While others approach 45 as wisps of vigor float away, this carnivore blazes like a roaring fire against the night. 

> Do not go gentle into that good night,  
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;  
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
