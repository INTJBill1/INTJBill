## Harbor Freight Trip 03 of 2023: The Tablesaw

I've been looking for jobsite table saws for over a month.  I never needed on in the past, but just made my own jigs and clamps for my circular saw to get the rips/crosscuts I needed.  It always required a bit of a setup, but I got exactly what I wanted.  Breaking down a 4x8 sheet of plywood was always awkward with the sheet resting atop a sheet of foam board.  

I thought I was gonna go with a DeWalt.  A couple of YouTube woodworkers said it's a good first-time table saw.  I even considered a cheaper Skilsaw version.  But, after watching others and being enamored by Harbor Freight, [this bear won me over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NerG1O528IA) along with a coupon of 10% off anything $50 or higher.

[HERCULES - 10 in., 15 Amp Compact Jobsite Table Saw with Rack and Pinion Fence](https://www.harborfreight.com/10-in-15-amp-compact-jobsite-table-saw-with-rack-and-pinion-fence-57673.html)

I dunno, it just makes sense to me to go with a company that gets the factory to build to their specs, because if they can procure the equipment at a lower price point, there's not the build-up of middlemen along the way.  Perhaps it's sorta like an ALDI or IKEA of tools?

Future purchases ahead!

## Physical Fitness

I have NOT been writing about my physical fitness regimen.  That's gonna change.  I've really put that area of my life on the back burner.  The thing is, everything remains up in the air regarding the move, but this is the time I can plan.  I'm pulling off my fitness events from my main calendar on Google for its own space.  In time, I'll even post it on this site.  The swimming component is gonna be an ABSOLUTE game-changer.  I worked that YMCA pool over so hard I developed shin splints.  Much more to plan out.  Stay tuned.
