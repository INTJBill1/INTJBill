## Futurism

Artificial intelligence is a step closer to a reality of futurism.  I have not felt this way about computers since my senior year of high school, when I first came online in the fall of 1995.  That technology changed fundamentally the way we did life, the way we interacted with one another and even the way we saw ourselves.  Was it for the better?  The value of the sword is in the hand of who wields it.  For most, I'm afraid, it speeds up idiots to be fully realized.

Earlier in my blog, I put on display the computer art I generated.  Daily, I employ Google Bard for my searches which, well, the mileage varies.  After suggesting for me to use dumbbells for chin ups, it proposed an incline dumbbell pullover for a back exercise, something I never considered for I have a disdain for the standard dumbbell pullover. 

I was curious as to how AI might work with the audio.  It is developing to be scary good.  Truly, it is only a matter of time before we will be able to pick the actors we want in the movies we wish to see.  Furthermore, as the hardware evolves, we could have a movie rendered in our living room on whatever themes we want.  

## Homeschool

It is a fun feeling mapping out the high school classes I'm going to teach for the next four years.  And yes, it is a surreal feeling because I remember what I experienced.  I have matrixed the State of Tennessee and various universities' requirements as a baseline before adding my own which OF COURSE are FULL of AWESOME BELL GRANDE! 

## Who I Am

In projecting ourselves, sometimes, we reach back to who we once were.  Now, less than a month from 45, with a lot of grayâ€”check that, silver staring back at me, who am I really?  What might I update on my About page? So often, we align ourselves with things so that others can associate us with the *Cool Kids at the Lunch Table*.  But strip all of that away: who, what, when, where, and how are we as we stand alone?  We overstate things that are inconsequential.  

## Bacon

In my last post, I referenced how I was going to give up bacon for The 33rd Expedition.  Perhaps I ought to have said I *hesitantly* give up bacon for 33E.  I mean, bacon is a SUPERFOOD!  Bacon kicked off some serious weightloss in The 17th Expedition.  In this current dive down the scale, while eating bacon and/or bacon drippings virtually every day since November, I have lost more than 70 pounds!  And it is not just one to two slices, but half the package, somewhere in the cooked three to four ounce range.  If I want it crispy, it will go sub three.

So, why pass the bacon?  I am curious to see if I have better results on more beef.  The macros will likely remain the same, that 200 to 220 fat grams and that 75 grams protein target.  Dare I try?

That said, if on Monday, I hit a double-digit weightloss for [a FIFTH time in a row](/fitness/#approach-4-the-high-fat-carnivore), I ain't gonna change a thing!
