Ahh, the last post of the year...

Isn't this when I regale my readers of the adventure of '23?  

Or look back with misty eyes at things I'd like to have back?  

Maybe even throw up fist pumps about leaving that UofM neighborhood for the 3rd/4th and final time to purchase a place in my hometown?

I suppose I could do all of *that*.

And yet, I am drawn toward the future.  Change yet remain *me*, the me that I ever was.  Some folks fade away, I ain't.  When I look out on the horizon of this upcoming year, I am reminded of the words I said in 2012 in my grad class over in the Czech when asked by my favorite professor how my teaching was going, "I'm kickin' ass and takin' names."

So it shall be.

Check out the final copy of my [New Year's Resoutions](/nyr/).  Instead of proclaiming it and then shoving it away to some shelf, I have a daily focus to accomplish every one of these.

I got to...[whatever it takes](https://open.spotify.com/track/6Qn5zhYkTa37e91HC1D7lb?si=e089cdf117884eb8).
