And thus far, *The 33rd Expedition* has been the most overconsuming of this HFC!  Before yesterday, I've averaged almost 90 grams of protein—last night, I absolutely FEASTED on 11-12 salt & pepper chicken wings (9.5 oz), making the daily protein SMASH 146 grams!  So, I'll be dialing things back in the upcoming couple of weeks as I prep for July 30's Expeditionary arrival.

Why the dietary hijinx?  CELEBRATION!

<mark>This is a time to <i>dance</i> in this liberation of unfettered trail footwear with arms outstretched joyously toward eternity; to <i>be</i> a crackling torch bursting in the darkness; and to <i>embrace</i> the unknown with a captivated heart and eyes set ablaze!</mark>

Too over the top?  Naw, *just* cleared it!

Yesterday, as I cleared the pool pump basket, I got to thinking: life is good.  I mean really *good*!  I've a good existence now and when I pass, I'm still me!  Forever.  Ain't death gonna hold me down.  I'm just getting started.

Sometimes, I get caught up in the world.  Sometimes, I'll pull over this ill-fitting cloak of the world, which in turn, shapes to depress me.  While not realizing it, these clothes of the world dump on me a fallen emotional state: 1) the weight of the futility of it all; 2) a loveless existence; and 3) no identity.  I quickly cast it aside.  That is NOT me.  Those clothes fit somebody else.

I got to thinking some more:  I need to bring back my December 31 Resolutions, but integrate the bread thing and the hobbies—although that hobbyist stuff really is a part of Dec 31.  New Year's resolutions are *New Year's* resolutions!  There's a reason why they excite me!  And sure, I'll update them to reflect the changes in 2023. 

I strive to be the best version of me.
