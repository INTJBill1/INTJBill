## AI Art of the Day

I have another gift handed down by our Cylon overlords!  I generated this on a whim today and...I TOTALLY could not control my laughter!

Think:  

*"a Pixar Cookie Monster eating bacon in a post-apocalyptic night"*  

Sure, bacon on a cookie—makes sense...the third eye—sure, radiation.  

What made me ABSOLUTELY lose it was what is between the cookie sandwich!  And thus, found nowhere else in the world...

## The Saddest Music Video I Know

The other day, I wanted to share on Facebook the saddest music video, but I never got around to it—I dunno, I must hesitate at sharing emotion on a busy street corner as people pass by. At least lemme have a hat for that sweet cash!  I might employ this clever technique I read off of [Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-most-effective-street-performing-hat-lines):

> I used to give away a bunch of dollar bills in my crowd gather. This served a number of functions, it:
>
* Amused people. I was doing something quite unexpected.
* Separated me from the crack heads/ desperate folks.
* Kept people there longer. They don't feel comfortable leaving with your money.
* Often came back multiplied several times over, for those who stayed.
* Ensured there would be bills to collect first thing when starting the hat pass.
* If people did have to go early, they'd interrupt the show to give back the money. (message to others: This is worth something, don't leave without giving)
I'm sure I lost a few dollars occasionally, but think it way more than paid for itself.

Incidentally, I once went to a Sunday night church service that passed out a plate full of $20 bills with the intent that we each pulled one out.  From there, the idea was to do something good with it.  This totally flips our scarcity mindset on its head.

So, what was the video?  Sting's *[Fields of Gold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLVq0IAzh1A)*.  I've known it since it came out some 30 years ago, but I've never watched its video until recently.  That video is what I experience when I walk around the UofM campus, drive by Piggly Wiggly or consider Wolfchase Galleria.
