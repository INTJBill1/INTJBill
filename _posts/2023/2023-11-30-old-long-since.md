This time of year, I'll feel that old familiar wave of nostalgia.  I open my eyes and see all of the old faces, I see each smile—family, friends, all vibrant and alive.  They motion me to follow them.  As I turn the corner, only the waft of once was remains in the hall.  The ticking of the clock shatters the silence.

*Old long since*, indeed.

I wave that thought away.  [*Wander My Friends...*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wmyrrkqPL0)

This is a strange time of year, isn't it?  Hours remain until we enter December 2023.  Throughout the month, I'll reminisce and shine toward the good times; I'll grimace and groan at those moments I wish I had back.  

While the past calls us back, we are at the precipice of the future.  I know change is coming; I welcome it.  I *want* to be better each following year until I, too, become a wisp of someone's memory.  

But *that* is the talk of my spirit of Christmas yet to come.

I've got a lot of GOOD things coming down the line in 2024.  You gotta realize ["you're living in the golden years"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-lxA13Eo1I).

> Mar cheo an tsléibhe uaine ag  
Imeacht go deo  
D'ainneoin ár dtuirse leanfam an tslí  
Thar chnoic is thar ghleannta  
Go deireadh na scríbi
