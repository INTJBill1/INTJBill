## "The Results Are In..."

After 6 weeks with a total of the following of ready-to-eat weights:

* **Bacon**: 8.4 lbs
* **Bacon Fat**: 5 cups
* **Butter**: 5.3 lbs 
* **Ghee**: 8.2 lbs
* **Ground Beef**: 10.1 lbs
* **Beef Liver**: 3.6 lbs
* **Large Eggs**: 17
* **Coffee**: 6.5 gallons
* **Oysters**: 0.5 cans
* **Prosciutto**: 0.5 lbs

I have lost 11 lbs (-4.4%) EVEN in the context of this leg injury and its swelling.  In the last 126 days of carnivore, I have lost a combined total of 54.5 lbs.  And CLEARLY as you can see above, I ain't starvin' with that low-calorie *Hug a Tree / Animals are People, Too* nonsense.  Naw, [I'm all this](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=WqOlHt--fOI&feature=share).  

I updated everything on the [Fitness page](/fitness/) for a comparative review (graphs/table).  The 30th Expedition nearly ran parallel to the 15th, with my current lead only attribute to that first six weeks out of the gate back in November.  That said, *The 16th Expedition: 20⚡25* faltered in terms of weightloss; I was only able to rally when I flipped the switch to carnivore in the waning moments.  I *should* be able to beat it and extend my lead further.

I had fun in *The 30th Expedition: Guilty Pleasures*.  The titles first reflected music that are my guilty favorites, just with parodied titles themed around my diet.  Perhaps my favorite rendition was the one I did for that Billy Ray Cyrus song: "I Won't Apply Part, Hibachi à la Carte. Adjust Donut—Sink It in the Sand!"  But the most challenging aspect was for me to run down 42 guilty favorites!  I just do not have that many; I tend to be proud of what music I choose.  But, there is an  oddball place in me regarding select Spice Girls off that first album, boy bands of the '90s—that sort of thing.  College stuff.

## Destination '23 in the Fast Lane

I optimized/stripped everything down out of New Year's Resolutions list to projects I am actively engaged in doing and one reach.  As much as I would like to learn Greek and remove the rust and repair my calculus, I do not seem to have the time with respect to other projects.  I do not want to do a mediocre job in Python development.  And other things I knocked off the list because I want to highlight a core.

## The 31st Expedition

All of the celebration is now behind me.  I am on to May 8 that is 41 days and 20 hours down the road.  As it relates to what I am bringing aboard this ship's stores, I like my BBBE rotation.  Unlike the past Expedition, there will be a lot more movement.  Even my VR set is coming online after being boxed for such a LONG time!  Daily resistance is a focus of this Expedition, but more Rocky IV than the Rock.  May 8 is around the corner.
