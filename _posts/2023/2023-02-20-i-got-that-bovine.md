## Just Food and Stuff

[*Parks and Recreation*: Grain'n Simple Vs Food and Stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSSJid7yLDg)

I am not locked into a daily, dietary habit—well, not beyond a month...OK, for now, I do shape the menu by planning what I will eat for the month ahead, and incidentally, my financial month starts each 22nd (the actual purchase really depends on when the weekend falls).  OK, so shove all of that to the side—you do not need to know how the sausage is made!  I had a slight diet shift: I am adding beef liver again!  I just was in the mood for it.

Thus, yesterday's intake, all values are after cooking, of course:

* **Bacon**: 2.5 oz
* **Coffee**: 3 cups
* **Bacon Fat**: 2 tbsps
* **Ground Beef**: 3.6 oz
* **Ghee**: 4.6 oz
* **Beef Liver**: 2.6 oz

For the day, it hits the mark: 202 grams of fat and 74 grams of protein.  It is not a perfect 200/75, but like City Planner Plays says, "Don't let perfect be the enemy of good."  And really, those are just guides.  Round numbers!  Rarely are things actually cleanly divisible by 25 and only half the time they are by 2.

I cooked a lb of liver in 2 tbsps of bacon, but I never count that—it is not like I lick the skillet after I am done cooking.  That cannot be said for the remnant that remained on my plate after I poured the 2 tbsps atop the liver:  Man!  Something about that liver's juice mixing into those bacon drippings that makes me throw societal convention out of the cave!  That plate was TASTY!  Let that be a secret between us.

Now as liver has carbs, I do not get stoked by that glucose store.  But, it is under 4 for the day.  A couple of days ago, I accepted another 4 carbs.  That time was: a half can of oysters in water!  I have never had it before, so I was unsure what my reaction would be.  It reminded me of seaweed snacks meets canned spinach.  It was small in size, but it packs a punch.  It is a treat.

## Inside Track Club

You are now reading the writing of an official *Inside Track Club* member.  Yes, I have joined [Harbor Freight](https://www.harborfreight.com/).  Lemme tell ya, it is an exclusive company I keep!  Does Aldi's have a secret *Order of the Bologna Society* I can join, too?  Seriously though, its membership packs more value than that silly Costco/Sam's Club nonsense.  With Harbor Freight, I can still shop the store without having a membership, but hey, a cart later with a membership and I can recoup the initial loss and then my year is wide-open.

And yes, these tools from a store aren't necessarily ones you mount on the wall to impress—well, spiders.  I do not know about other niches, but with woodworkers, their shops are littered with things on the wall; they're like trophies.  Personally, I would like to hide away my organization with a barn door or even make a secret wood panel door in case my shop is broken into.  I almost like [this guy's shop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCDaE-0pXoY).  I'll heed solutions regarding workflow.

In the past, I have been almost all DeWalt and Craftsman (before Sears sold them).  And now...I am about me, or more specifically, the production/results.  It is consistent with my not pumping my chest about the logo of my #2 pencil.  And frankly, in the past, there have been times out of speed, instead of grabbing my Craftsman wrench to work on something, I used a wrench from an off-brand, emergency stash I used to keep in my Chevy Silverado.  What happened?  The job got done.  There is no magic fairy dust.  And there isn't a Sears that I *could* return my wrench to these days.  Harbor Freight has a great return policy. 

Beyond the $30 membership for the year, I have not purchased anything yet, but I am making my shopping list.  It is *way, way, way* too easy to go on a shopping spree splurge there.  I think the prudent course of action is to consider the project at hand and buy the tools necessary to get the job done.
