I plopped my $5 down for a month's worth of access to Todoist Pro.  It's good to offload all of the content in my head and scour around for my Post-it notes to add more.  Unfortunately, most of it is spatially organized in my head, which lends itself to a bit of a slow retrieval.

Yesterday, my site had several updates.  Some of it was structural for organization and consistency.  Overall, I wanted stuff that's useful to me, like bringing back ἁγιασμός as a page.  Or with a hotlink to adventures with *tunes*.  Then there's the re-organization of *fit* that should propel me forward. 

That said, I'm revealing my hand early on a '24 resolution by listing my *Nested Loops* reading plan.  It's an ambitious plan with a sunset of about when I hit 83.  We'll see how the first year goes, but in context to how ALL of this is just a very brief leadup of ἁγιασμός to what I'll *really* be doing with my life, it's an outstanding idea. 

The reading plan contains the very living words of God—how can I NOT read it every day?  These words are of the One who designed me and chose to adopt me as his son.  How can I not spend my time in this airport lounge receiving his words before the adventure that awaits?

> For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.

>Hebrews 4:12 ESV
