It does jazz me up in those dregs of the 3 o'clock AM hour.

## Resistance

It was a good, second week of resistance.  As I moved the duties of tracking my reps/rests from my phone to my Garmin watch, I have freed up some precious minutes and again, I reworked my PDF of *(media content yanked to optimize site)*
.

On some days, I added a 4th exercise.  On those that are unchanged, I bumped the reps to 20.  On my end, I adjusted the weight accordingly to my ability.  That said, I am gonna have a cornucopia of FAILURE this week with the added reps!

## Cardio

While driving home from the gym this past week, I thought to myself that I really need to work out of 2021's playbook.  Chiefly in developing my cardio for my 5K races, I signed up with a Panera coffee subscription as a daily target to reach.  I would run 3 miles there and walk with a coffee in hand 1.8 miles back.

That said, I am likely at a weight on January 2021, when my running routine was still months away.  But, that is not the point.  Plus, so far, I am running 6 weeks faster in my weightloss than before.  [I am scheduled](/fitness/#competition-the-ketocarnivore-vs-hfc) to see if I can overcome 7 lbs, but I have already passed that.  Perhaps I ought to see if I beat out 14 lbs?
