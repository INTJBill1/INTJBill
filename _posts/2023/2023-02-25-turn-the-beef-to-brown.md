I may be a little vexed with YouTube Music (YTM) lack of playlist sort, something that has been with Spotify for a decade.  I'm guessing they have a greater focus on albums over user playlists.  At any rate, I was amused by this Reddit comment:

> Kinda hilarious that a product team within a company owned by an entity called Alphabet Inc. doesn't have an alphabetical option.

Well said.

That said, while YTM just doesn't have a robust user community (likely because of the above) and instead relies on YouTube playlists instead of songs off of albums, it is possible to create one!  I'm pulling together a massive country music playlist of stuff primarily from the 90s, what my radio used to play.  And frankly, I forget how much of my brain space has been reserved to sing-a-long to all of those songs.  Can't I free that up for something *valuable*?

11. ...That ain't my truck in her drive, man, this ain't my day tonight.  Looks like she's in love and I'm out of luck.
