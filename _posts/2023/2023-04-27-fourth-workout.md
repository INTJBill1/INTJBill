In past years, I did two exercises per delt on my *Shoulders* day for a total of 6.  But those days also feature a 4x12 approach.  Today's 5x15 is a time suck!  Thus, just one exercise for each:

* DB Side Lying Rear Delt Raises
* DB Upright Rows
* DB Arnold Press

That 45-minute window blew by.  At BRC, I did...

* 25 minutes walking on a 7-7.5% incline treadmill
* 17 minutes climbing on an arc trainer
* 26 minutes walking on the indoor track
* 28 minutes walking with outdoor walking

In the cardio room, not only did I go crashing on the ground but I also left my phone behind.  But, as all I do is win now, even those are notched on my belt.  In cleaning the treadmill, the metal leg that holds up the cleansing rag snagged my foot.  As I fell, I had the athletic presence of mind, to turn 180°, land on my right glute (the same side I got snagged on) and then flow into the fall, even pushing with my arms at one point.  

Now the phone thing came after my time on the arc trainer.  I climbed up the stairs and began striding when my bluetooth cut out.  Hurriedly I returned, again facing those stairs picked it up and climbed 'em for a second time.  You know what I noticed?  They are markedly easier than a couple of Sundays ago.  I am still training going down as it is not as smooth as 2021.  That said, the progress is remarkable. 

I left the BRC and walked to the adjoining neighborhood...MY neighborhood...well, was.  I walked to my childhood home, a place I knew for more than 18 years.  I always planned on walking by that place.  I even had that 5K planned in 2021:

But, I never did...until today.  It was...a moving experience.  It felt so very familiar, as if I was a high school kid again...or expecting to go out on another Saturday night in college—time for a Memphian Club, Kentucky Pie and a Sweet Tea from McAlister's!  I could write at length about everything I felt and remembered...and everything I know and everyone I knew are...well...truthfully, I am [so far away](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=vTxFQGb3Op4&feature=share).  And this is a good thing.  I only wish people who saw me then could see me now.
