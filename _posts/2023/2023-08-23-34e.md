I broke that "new" habit of the past month and earned the grammatically illustrious achievement of...

<p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic;font-size:1.2rem;">Current streak: 001 day.</p>

So like a Journey song, I get the joy of rediscovering carnivore.  This "highway run into the midnight sun" has defined what I have done since 2018, even before I knew what would be.

Will there be 3 AMs in my future?  Will I kick each day off at 2:30 AM—*oh, how I do love the night!*  These nights—I have been staying up to times I used to set my alarm for!  No, I am sure I will pull all of that together.  The thing I do now is just take a step forward.  

It is a singular thing.  It does not have to be this convoluted plan of attack that relies on a series of successful outcomes to fall into place for victory—it's no Ardennes Offensive.  

I just needed to do one thing yesterday: "I took my (bacon), I took it down."  String together a series of days like what I just did and BLAM, that's how you drop 100 lbs.  What I do with my time are enhancements.  But as far as weightloss goes, like a Cars' song, I did "just what I needed."  

Just repeat.  I'm reminded of Pearl Jam's [*Just Breathe*](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=_7ioE4wRil8&si=2YgQVR9smuFZBbD5).

And I step to the edge  
To see my world below.  
And I laugh at myself  
While the tears roll down,  
'Cause it's the world I know,   
Oh, it's the world I know.
