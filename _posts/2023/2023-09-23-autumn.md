It is 100 Days until the new year.

That said, THE season of the year has arrived.  From summer's reprieve and the fall of leaves to my Carniverary and Thanksgiving with buildups to Christmas and New Year's Eve, can there *be* a better season?  

And THIS is the season in which I rumble into a string of Carnivore wins.  I had a soft opening to my Carnivore routine: I ran it for 3 days.  The rhythm is ready.

I am not doing the Expeditionary approach of 2018-2023; I am not weighing myself.  I just can't do anything with those numbers!  They are the sort of thing that looks good on paper.  No, I'm interested in capabilities and aesthetics.  I did the numbers game; chasin' that scale is a hollow pursuit.

## From the Start of Fall to the Start of Spring: FTL Jumps & Tape Measure

Speaking of capabilities and aesthetics, I am writing things down to compare notes.  Winter is coming...where I will be when winter leaves?

## The Countdown

<p>
<div id="cd1">
  <span id="cd1days"></span> days,
  <span id="cd1hours"></span> hours,
  <span id="cd1minutes"></span> minutes, and
  <span id="cd1seconds"></span> seconds until Spring '24
</div>

<script>
function countdown() {
  // Get the current date and time in Memphis time.
  var now = new Date(new Date().toLocaleString("en-US", {timeZone: "America/Chicago"}));

  // Get the date and time of March 19, 2024 10:07 PM in Memphis time.
  var targetDate = new Date(2024, 2, 19, 22, 7, 0);

  // Calculate the time difference between now and March 19, 2024 10:07 PM.
  var diff = targetDate - now;

  // Convert the time difference to days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
  var days = Math.floor(diff / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
  var hours = Math.floor((diff % (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)) / (1000 * 60 * 60));
  var minutes = Math.floor((diff % (1000 * 60 * 60)) / (1000 * 60));
  var seconds = Math.floor((diff % (1000 * 60)) / 1000);

  // Update the countdown display.
  document.getElementById("cd1days").innerHTML = days;
  document.getElementById("cd1hours").innerHTML = hours;
  document.getElementById("cd1minutes").innerHTML = minutes;
  document.getElementById("cd1seconds").innerHTML = seconds;
}

// Start the countdown.
setInterval(countdown, 1000);
