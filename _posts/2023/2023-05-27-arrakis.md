I have continued my diet streak now for 187 days.  Since I took the prior to 637, I don't think about my streaks much these days—I should.  There was a time I found pride in making 86 days. 

Again, I once proudly wore this T-shirt:

*(front:)*

![Race 1, Front](/images/race1a.png){:class="race"}

*(back:)*

![Race 1, Back](/images/race1b.png){:class="race"}

I loved that shirt (even if now it is in a landfill—"on to Cincinnati") because it captured a summary of all the times I earned it, that I dug deep and made the play.  And within its subtext, it told a story of when streaks were snapped.  Yet, in my shame, I inserted another coin to play the game.  That was the early tagline to my site: INSERT COIN.

I say all of that because I almost snapped my streak yesterday.  This week has been challenging.  Yesterday, it all reached a singular point as I traveled metaphorically through a murky stretch of woods.  I addressed a bit of it in the proceeding post.  

This moment underscores how untrustworthy a feeling can be.  In the moment, it *feels* like I can roll with it.  A part of me says, "Yeah, you know that Little Debbie snack cake with the creme?  That'll totally make you feel good!"  But, I've been down that road...I never win when I do.  Short-term fun for what?  And if it was a single moment, sure, it would just be a blip on the trail.  But, it is at the minimum a 3-month tumble that takes just as long to rest.  And there goes half of my year in this tug-of-war to just wind right back at the startling line with a 0.  So, that is why I refrain.  In those weak moments, I gotta trust the decision I already made, that I feel better when I win.
