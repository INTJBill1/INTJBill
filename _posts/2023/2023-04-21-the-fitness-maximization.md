## Hometown Pride

I have now been a re-resident of Bartlett for over a month now.  It is *good* to be back, though it is a stranger world than the one I left behind.  Everything and everyone seem the way they should be, but it is just a little off-kilter, as if traveling through parallel worlds in the *Sliders* universe and I *almost* got it right in finding home again.  Close enough.  I just hit the one where Bolton, cotton fields and all, is a Memphis City School, Wolfchase is the Mall of Memphis and friends are not who they once were.

## Fat Fast

A couple of nights ago, I consumed a LOT of protein; I ate a couple of days worth: 147 grams! I just had one of those days when I was hungry!  OK, so, I actually overate.  Hey, it was prosciutto and some slim, ALDI ribeye-simply irresistible!  I may have worked a few hours out in the yard.

That evening, I thought I'd give something a shot for the next day, something I've heard other carnivores do in various iterations: a fat fast.  

Now, I am no stranger to actual fasting, that is, water fasting.  There have been an endless array of 1-2 day ones and others at various lengths, with my favorite being that 4+26 one in the Czech Republic that closed up my graduate work.

I had full confidence I could take on a single day.  And frankly, this really isn't a fast, not in terms of discipline.  All I did was make sure I hit my mark of 200 grams of fat.  I already do the 0-carb thing.  I could go without protein for a day.

It was simple:  I did my standard stick-and-a-half of butter into an iced coffee in the morning.  Later, I did the same with 6 tbsps of butter.  That was my day.

Would I term it a *fast*?  No, I would not.  I am already adapted to a carnivore diet and I did not feel as though I abstained from anything.  I just didn't eat protein for the day so as to mitigate the **gluconeogenesis** from the other day.

Yeah, that's the whole thrust of my HFC approach this time around: to avoid excess protein consumption thereby kicking off gluconeogenesis.

## Fitness Schedule

Coming soon!  I've got the general schedule in place and now I've gotta hammer out the daily schedule.  Stay tuned!

## Another Resolution Goes Down

A couple of days ago, I shaved off my untouched, New Year Beard.  That Yeard will have to be shelved for 2024.  I liked it, though I regretted I ever colored it.  Still, I did it as I began taking my physical training seriously.  I've got the resolutions in the shop right now as I figure out where in the heck do I want to take them.
