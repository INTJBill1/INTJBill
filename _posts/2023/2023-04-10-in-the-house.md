Ahh, this is *so* amusing!  I missed including in yesterday's Easter post this amusing video by *The Babylon Bee*:

It highlights a favorite apologetic acronym of mine, something I picked up years ago regarding Christ's death, burial and resurrection, the greatest FEAT of all time.

* **F - Fatal Torment** Jesus died.  He did NOT barely survive.  His manner of death even fulfilled OT prophecy.
* **E - Empty Tomb** - There was no body.  If there was, the Pharisees could pull it out when His followers proclaimed Him to be alive.  They would not have said that his disciples stole the body.
* **A - Appearances After Death** - Jesus appeared to 500 witnesses after His death.  People could be directly asked if they saw Him.  Jesus even had a fish fry on the beach with His disciples.  I find this ever so delightful.
* **T - Transformation of the Disciples** - His disciples went from cowards who denied Him after living daily with Him for 3 years to those who suffered in this life and endured a horrible death for His namesake.  Many people live for a lie.  Who dies for a lie?

## Today's Homeschool

I spent my first period with the kids this morning on...4 verses.  But, to be fair, it is a hunk of meat!  I am using Hebrews 11 as an opening for a future run through some prominent characters in the Old Testament and their roles as types and shadows of Christ.  Since the Old and New Testaments focus on Jesus, a strategic survey supported by expository tactics is not a shabby idea.

Later, I did a review on those tired algebraic problems...

> Two drivers leave the same place to travel to the same destination. The first driver leaves two hours earlier than the second driver. The first driver travels 52 miles per hour, and the second driver travels 68 miles per hour. How many hours will it take the second driver to overtake the first driver? 
> 
> *(The answer is 6.5 hours)*

Now, the school I went to growing up focused on these sorts of things.  Typical, right?  I mean, yeah, I could sit down with a notepad and hammer that out but couldn't I just give them a holler on the horn when I pass by 'em?  

## Fitness

I entitle this post with [a track from the *28 Days Later* soundtrack](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=aF10I72tsio&feature=share).  It specifically reminds me of 2021 and how I was amused myself to go running in the morning in the context of a post-apocalyptic world full of zombies. 

This week I gear up to a greater fitness regimen while opening up the throttle on everything else.  The thing is, I have not been slacking in life; I have been busy.  I just gotta optimize things.

I actually have plans of creating my 5K race construct, the kind where I create races of 1 entrantâ€”well, I do not give out ribbons/trophies.  No one wins in my races.  Like the ol' Russian reversal, 

**In America, you win race.  In Soviet Russia, race win YOU!**

(Incidentally, [this other song](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=15s5FbW-as4&feature=share) is from the same soundtrack and is fun for running, though it reminds me of my past explorations of London.)
