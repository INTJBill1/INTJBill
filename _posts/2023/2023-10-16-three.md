Last Wednesday on my fat fast, I was feeling like my ol' Superman self.  Or do I line up better to the Dark Knight?  Then there's Wolverine—*(throws up hands in exasperation)*—well, some kind of superhero!    

I felt *powerful* that morning!  Thus, for TEN hours, I bussed furniture from stop-to-stop; I Rubik's Cubed the whole place.  It would be underselling it for me to say I was sore that night.  But, it felt like one of those *good* sores.

*Boy howdy* did I get that one wrong!

I woke up the next morning with my left foot flaring up.  In the upcoming days, I wound up on crutches—AGAIN.  Yes, a moment ago I was on crutches for my right foot, and now it's my left.  Wow! Not only can I work a computer mouse with both hands I am injury-ambidextrous!

*\*sigh\**

"First-to-Worst, party of none?"

And to ease the discomfort, what did I turn to?  The sugars.  ALL the sugars.  I gotta have a better understanding why I turn to carbs for comfort, especially as carbs have a tendency to shove me down a flight of stairs. 

It's so...event-driven—the build-up, the sights and the sounds.  I *know* better.  Proteins *heal*.  Fats *fuel*. Carbs are *a pack of wolf kids let loose inside of a Yankee Candle*.

The other day I wrote:

>Still, the past will forever mean something special to me, all the pivotal shifts, whether... 
>  
>...1994's freedoms...
>
>...2004's journeys...
>  
>...2014's new beginnings...
>
>...2024's...

I did not fill in the blank.  It's the sort of thing that is retrospective, right?  Still, some of it can be targeted on the front end; else, it'll be just like one of those largely unremarkable years.  I want *more* than that.  While 2024's specifics remain shrouded, I can set forth in a direction.

Well, lemme pencil that in:

...2024's <span style="color: #818589; border: 1px solid #ccc;padding: 0 .5rem 0 .5rem;">transformations</span>

Look, would I pick up these overuse, acute injuries if I had an everyday fitness regimen?  Or, do I let entropy reign and just become another one of my peers?   

>I look ahead to all the plans that we made  
And the dreams that we had.  
I'm in a world that tries to take 'em away.  
Oh, but I'm taking 'em back.     
>...  
>It's not my time.  
I'm not going.  
There's a fear in me—  
It's not showing.  
This could be the end of me  
And everything I know.

I am convinced of this: at 46, I will be in the best shape of my life.  We're talking about rolling out of bed to pump out the pushups, practicing taijiquan, and signing up for 5Ks kind of shape!  I have my designs set on being a lean bodybuilder, a martial artist, and a runner.  And yes, I recognize that I envision this while I can't even take a single step forward while just twenty lbs from that last ker-klunk on the scale.

I am reminded of another song wafting in the air I breathed in 2012:

> Hello,    
Are you still chasing the memories in shadows?  
**Some stay young, some grow old.**  
Come alive.  
There are thoughts unclear you can never hide.  
>...  
>I *dare* you to tell me to walk through fire.  
Wear my soul and call me a liar.

Every day matters.  Each day contributes toward *The Three*.  There is value in maintaining a daily logsheet to note how each day was invested toward each third.
