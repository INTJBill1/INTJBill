A delightful meal for today: a couple of eggs and burger patties with a mass of bacon lining things up to be a 232 / 77 / 1 day.  

This diet is defined as "diet" in its broad sense.  And maybe that is the key: there is no willpower needed to do something extraordinary.  You just need [a good food journal](https://cronometer.com/#diary) *(and there is an argument I could just keep this thing in a spiral-bound notebook).*

Most importantly, the 30,000-foot view post-weightloss plan is in place.  I have a vision of the future.  Yes, in a mere twelve weeks, I once cut weight like nobody's business on a low-calorie, (1000-1240 / daily) semi-starving approachâ€”explodes carnivore out of the water!  You see, I dug deep and lost 70 lbs on THREE occasions on that way!  But what always gnawed in the back of my mind was what I would do in the *After*.  I simply was *not* gonna eat dehydrated broccoli, spinach, and flaxseed forever!

On the other hand, could I eat this morning's break-fast forever?  You can bet your bottom dollar!  And that is why I can see my future and look forward to stepping into what I once only dreamt.

Weightloss solved.  

And this is the last post I will write on my diet until I hit goal weight, as I raise the Bolton High c/o '96 banner again.  

Befitting words call back to me as a 24-year-old in December 2002 speaks to this 45-year-old guy in [*Change*](/2002-12-03-change/).
