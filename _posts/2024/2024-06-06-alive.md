To the tunes in my headphones of...

> I wanna lay like this forever  
Until the sky falls down on me  

...and...

A total eclipse of the heart 

...I went down on one knee in the grass, fell over like a sack of potatoes, and gazed at the sky, thinking to myself,

I thought how much the ground feels like a mattress.  I was so tired; that soft bed was irresistible. I even stretched my arm across the sheet.  Then I had one overwhelming wave in me,

2024 has been the year of wacko body unhandled exceptions.  Totally wish I could [Roy it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nn2FB1P_Mn8)!  Today *shouldn't* have floored me.  It was maybe 80â„‰ with overcast skies, though the humidity was around 96%.  My stamina just drained so fast as I pushed the lawn mower and edged the front yard.  I just remember sweating more than normally and having to focus on my legs because my arms didn't have it.   I didn't even get the chance to start the backyard!

Of course, I cut the yard about a week ago and had no issues other than my Atlas 80V batteries draining dry so much that I did manual labor trying to get them recharged to finish up the cut.

It has been 9 hours later; I remain weakened.

It is just this zombie bite from February.  *\*sigh\** *Enough* already.  I miss my mornings.  Green light! 

On a positive note, I now fit into my new L shirts, though I still prefer XL.  Long ago were those 4XL days, but I remain me no matter where I wind up on the scale.  

Today, I also received a decently researched [WiFi router](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B096K9SVCT/) and [a 3-pack of shades](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0995MYSRN).  I haven't worn sunglasses since college (and they involved shades of yellow and green).
