What's the music for this diary entry?  A favorite genre: [***Rock the Yacht** Setting sail on a sea of smooth Yacht Rock grooves*](https://www.accuradio.com/channel/Rock%20the%20Yacht/1578?k=rock%20the%20yacht).  It features songs like Michael McDonald's *I Keep Forgettin' (Every Time You're Near)* (1982), Paul Davis's *Cool Night* (1981), and my beloved King Harvest's *Dancing in the Moonlight* (1972).

It is more of a theory than an application.  Beyond that Power Wheels Bigfoot from Nanny when I was 6 or so, the first vehicle I ever drove with a "steering wheel" was a yacht.  I guess it was the summer of '91 out on the Tennessee River.  The yacht featured a booth for eating, a galley, and a stateroom below deck.  He handed over the helm to this 13-year-old kid.   

It was a yacht belonging to a retired friend of my fatherâ€™s, a gentleman from New Zealand, a mythical, faraway country that's on my bucket list to go.  Yes, the home of *The Lord of the Rings* and *The Hobbit* trilogies; the *Avatar* series; the *Chronicles of Narnia* trilogy; and Viva La Dirt League of TechTown and [*Baelin's Route*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEe-ZeVbTLo).

There's something about adventure that is so *compelling*, isn't there?

As to my own quests, I continue to scaffold.  I enter day 2 of this sardine fast inspired by Dr. Boz.  This time around, passing 72 hours will be a Ryan George "Super Easy, Barely an Inconvenience" ([Harry Potter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8uJtWtDkk4))  The way I prepare it makes it look like taco meat and the heat DOMINATES the flavor profile even with the inclusion of mustard.

My workout game is...eh, not overwhelming.  I put in two hours of yardwork yesterday morning for the front yard and shortly I'll go to work in the backyard.  For now, it is over-complicated on paper.
