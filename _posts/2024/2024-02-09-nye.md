After my Arms workout this morning, I was awarded two Garmin badges: fulfilled my Gains req's and I worked out on the Chinese New Year's Eve 2024.  Historically, I've used this data as a reset for my resolutions, but those remain rock solid; I'll still be talking about New Year's Resolutions in July!  

Instead, it made me rethink a few things, how can I put myself in a more remarkable position to achieve what I set out to do in the beginning.  

This year is special:  I have accomplished physical transformation.  Yes, yes, the body needs the time to match the image.  But the mental game?  I changed me:

* I cannot see eating anything else but carnivore; Twinkies seem like eating a couch cushion;  

* I look forward each weekday to my lifting sessions—I love seeing the pump;

* I train every day to become better than the black belt I once was;

* I love the mental space of my morning walks, mapping out Bartlett and strengthening the mental fortitude to not quit as I prepare for my 5K races.

The change has happened.  It is just a matter of time for my abilities and aesthetics to catch up.  

This is the year when *I* will burst into a room, bearing a six-pack and toned calves, my face aglow with kindness with a smile that is contagious. I'm ALIVE!
