Yesterday's Steak Saturday was FANTASTIC!

1. 9 oz. ribeye...  
2. ...followed by half-a-package of bacon...  
3. ...and 2¼ sticks of butter for the day with 6 cups of coffee.

I *could* unfold the strategy for Saturday, but I do not own a pocket protector.  I have always thought owning one is a good idea! It would *totally* match these suspenders I wear now!

The key to life really is to disconnect from the keychain and drive, isn't it?

As Duran Duran's [*Come Undone*](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=5X5KweDhsaI&si=6RoEZWNacH_tJb7H) plays on, the title of a lost post from then, this phase of 2024 feels like 2019 to me: 

> Words, playing me déjà vu  
Like a radio tune, I swear I've heard before  

No, I don't suppose *Stranger Things* season 3 will be releasing this July 4 any more than this Billy could visit the Starcourt Mall.  But, 2019 felt like *something* different...[maybe like this?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GSgWzmR_-c)—I started to believe.  On a low-calorie approach, I got down the scale to where I am currently camping, though 2019's October was shipwrecked by an emotional response, the subject of Kelly Hogan's latest video, [*Let's please fix this: EMOTIONAL EATING.*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRceqOtsITU)

I suppose I ought to consider this 220-210 lb place to be threatening time with my risk of blowing up in size. Failure points of...

* **Nov '18**: 218 lbs then a 77-lb gain
* **Oct '19**: 211.25 lbs then a 65.75-lb gain
* **June '23**: 215 lbs then a 59-lb gain

I survived it in 2021, though the time frame lasted for 4 Expeditions: 220.25 → 213 → 209 → 210 → 197.5.  I tinkered a bit with things and I got it fixed.

This time around with my HFC #2 macro-focused with its mental toughness built-in via my Fat Focus days twice a week, I fully expect to just leap over any kind of challenge.  I skipped most of the 220s on it and I am in position to just skip the 2-aughts.  

In THIS year, I want to claim that 182 mark of 2021 and push further to that Everlong standard, *the fabled 163*, the place I was when the world was a different place: 1995.  It is *right* there for the taking...[*Right Now!*](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=R6rcHegBNvc&si=C1iHmtUKC-VvG-q2) 

Not related, but I was delightfully surprised as I stumbled across Taylor Swift's synthwave song, [*Fortnight*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3zqJs7JUCQ), which has *got* to be a callback with its tune to the new wave band, New Order's [*Bizarre Love Triangle*](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=bKVbB_qZQcU&si=XiP3HLFm4kUnaSG3).  *Fortnight's* video reminded me of the equally visually beautiful and powerful Smashing Pumpkin's [*Stand Inside Your Love.*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nm4xv3firw).  OH! And I *loved* the Ethan Hawke cameo!  That 1970 is a good vintage: Matt Damon, Tina Fey...
