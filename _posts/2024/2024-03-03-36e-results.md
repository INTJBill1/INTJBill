Yes, in my SECOND win of 2024, I lost 5.44% for a 13 lb weightloss, skipping the 230s entirely!  While I predicted this amount *exactly* weeks ago, it is the most I've lost in a third of a series of Expeditions in a non-semi-starving (<1200 kcal) context.  Incidentally, it is only 1.75 lbs away from tying that Expedition!  I prefer to apply my willpower toward other fronts.  

You can see exactly what I ate on my [Intake section](expeditions/#intake).  If you're interested in calories, it was at 2262 kcal/daily, about 100 calories less than the last Expedition.  Obviously they don't matter as 42,000+ calories less for The 9th Expedition only netted me 1.75 lbs.

I found my two-a-week fat focus days made my protein consumption difficult to manage.  I don't know if it contributed to my success, but I did find my removal of bacon for its entirety made it a less enjoyable Expedition.  I'm guessing the increased walking workload contributes to the additional 1% loss? 

At any rate, you can see how my input lines up with [NYR24 here](/nyr/#status).  Basically, I dropped another pant size to fall into 38.  My Golden Ratio increased and my arms remained the same despite me pulling the cord on my lifting from this damning sicknessâ€”that MUST change.  I find the combination of compromised lungs and general numbness is a chief demotivator.  But, I'll rise; I always do.
