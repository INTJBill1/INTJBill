## Hulk Mash

Via an Instant Pot and three chicken quarters, I made my own chicken broth for the first time.  While I never wound up replacing coffee with broth, I still drink at least 4 cups per day of that soothing, salty elixir.  The chicken meat is more of a byproduct of the process to be tossed to the kids.  As everything falls apart and separates from its once $.36/lb frozen mass, I use the released skin to turn into crisps via my Instant Pot Vortex 6-Quart air fryer.  And the bones?  I handed off a couple to the kiddos and at the rest of them myself.  There was something about it that felt...right.  I didn't throw anything away. 

## Hulk Smash

Yesterday was a big day: you'll recall on December 24th, I bested May's highest step count of the year.  Well, now in 2024, I want to take everything from 2023, so I beat that new score.

The other day, I beat the final record from May '23: longest goal streak (10 days).  As of today, that 10,944 daily target streak is at 13 days, Dec 23, 2023 - Jan 4, 2024.

## Hulk Dash

I've given a second thought about holding off my 5K races.  As my New Year's Resolutions state, I gotta hit <179 lbs for I can cross that threshold.  Well, geez, that's gonna take a *good long* while; I don't want to double/triple up the back end like 2021.  Need significance. 

I won't change the wording, but I just won't let myself physically run before 179.  It's just more impactful if it's held toward the end of each month.  I mean, I don't *mind* holding off to September of whatever, but there's value in daily training toward an objective in the near term.  

PLUS—and this is a big one—the monthly winner of the 5K events will receive an appropriately themed BELT BUCKLE!  The overall grand champion for the *The 2024 WOLVERINE Cup Series* will not only receive a Wolverine-themed buckle, but a set of windproof running pants and winter running jacket for 2025 (contingent on the sponsor forking over the cash)!
