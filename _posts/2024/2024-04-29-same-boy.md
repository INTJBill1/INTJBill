I am beyond another Fat Focus Sunday and leap into a Fish Monday!  At the 4 AM hour, I feasted: 

1. Two ALDI fillets of wild salmon (6.3 oz);  
2. A half package of burnt-by-distraction bacon (2 oz);
3. Two Walmart *100% Pure Beef Burgers* (4.2 oz); 
4. A stick of butter with 16 oz. of coffee poured over ice. (followed by ½ stick with 16 at 5-6 AM)

And that'll be it for the day!  *(I'm stuffed!)*

Some *bland* facts:

* Today's fat kcal percentage (82%) does not match my target of **87%+** but after today, I am 89.6% for The 38th Expedition.  

* Today's protein (98 grams) contributes to getting the average into the target range (65-75).  Currently: 60.3 grams. 

I say all of that to show that I am not all willy-nilly goin' around with a flippant approach!  The targets I have chosen, namely fat %, tend to suggest their efficacy toward weightloss.  

For all nine HFC Expeditions (54 weeks), there is a correlation of greater weightloss at 220 grams of fat than for 200 grams.  *(Yes, I lose even **more weight** by eating **more fat** on a high-fat diet!)*  An upper 60's protein / 230 fat approach may be best, though I have nothing of the upper end.  This Expedition, I put the target for a daily 235.  But there is a lot of variability regarding workouts and the impact of my FF days.

I do not have a gameplan for weight maintenance.  Yes, I am nowhere near that point, some 50 lbs away.  This underscores my approach: I am already there—at least with my mind, the part that matters!  

But there is a joy felt in experiencing those scale slides, a wave of estatic upwelling that washes over me when the number dives below that 200 lb floor, as what happened in '21 on the Holiday of Bill: [*23: The (One)90s Are Back!*](/2021-08-12-23-the-(1)90s-are-back/)

And I am coming upon the month when for only the second time in 19 years, I just may experience that feeling again on a May 26.

Since I am dropping weight and gotta think about that New Year's Resolution, last night, I bought a 2-pack more of those [Hanes 100% long-sleeved, black, polyester shirts](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KBZSQ64) and two pairs of black, [slim-fit, golf pants](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096YPT5QX) from Amazon.  

The pants were $12.20 each, but today they bumped the price to $38.90.  HOWEVER, the next size down is $12.20 *(wasn't last night)* so I picked up a couple more in 36" since I can technically fit in that now, though a slim fit remains out of reach!  I also bought the next size down for Hanes, a large.

So my wardrobe is conforming to the aesthetic of black polyester—no collar for casual, collar for [*It's a Saturday Night*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgkVGqsRbAM).  Not including my *fantastic*, 25% cotton [Black Rifle Coffee Company t-shirt](https://www.blackriflecoffee.com/products/brcc-company-shirt?variant=10-014-050), I have been removing cotton fabric out from my closet.  Cotton fades as soon as you stash it in your closet!
