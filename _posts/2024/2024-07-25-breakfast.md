## Supplemental

It's 2018 all over again, for today I purchased again, a two-a-day pill case.  But, not for prescriptions—no, I'll never need *THAT* in my life, but I'm rolling on the supplement game! 

 *"And the crowd erupts in a thunderous roar of elation!"*

Now *By the Power of Meat, I Have the Power*, what I already eat is effective, but I want to see if I can enhance myself further.

Better than he was before.  
Better. Stronger. Faster.

This list is incomplete, but this is the opening salvo of my campaign:

* NoSalt® Original Sodium-Free Salt Alternative - for increased potassium.

I'm trying out the *Pure Supplements* brand.  They offer the supplements you want.  Just that.  Throw it into a gelatin capsule.  Done.  Seems like an obvious thing, 

* Ginkgo Biloba (10:1 400 mg)
* Turmeric Curcumin (1000 mg)
* Cayenne Pepper (400 mg)

Then there's some old stuff that shies away from a serving suggestion:

* J.CROW'S® Lugol's Solution of Iodine 2% 2oz 

This stuff appears to be powerful.  I ran ChatGPT to figure out my dose:

> **Weekly Iodine Requirement**
> - Daily Iodine Requirement for Adult Men: 150 mcg
> - Weekly Iodine Requirement: 1050 mcg
>
> **Steps to Achieve Weekly Iodine Intake**
>  
> 1. **Dilute One Drop:**
>   - Mix 1 drop of Lugol's 2% solution in 3.38 oz (100 ml) of water.
>
>2. **Daily Dosage:**
   - To meet the weekly requirement of 1050 mcg, drink approximately 0.203 oz (about 1.2 teaspoons) of the diluted solution daily.

Though, research seems to indicate I could go with a whopping tablespoon of the dilution.

And perhaps I'm just spinning my wheels here with these supplements, but these are some of the targets I'm hitting as whipped up by ChatGPT:


>1. **Blood Pressure:**

## Fundamental

Am I no longer a carnivore?  I know I haven't seen too many cayenne coyotes howlin' at night!

That's been a debate in the carnivore community.  Spices, coffee, etc.  I suppose every diet has its denominations and sects.  Of course in broader terms, there are many religions for sure!  Atheists are SAD, of course, with their standard American diets.  Agnostics count calories.  Then there are the other religions: Carnivore, Pescatarian, South Beach, Mediterranean, Paleo, Zone, DASH, Whole30, Flexitarian, Low-FODMAP, Macrobiotic, Raw Food, Ketogenic (Keto), Intermittent Fasting, Gluten-Free, Vegetarian, Vegan, and Fruitarian.

It's something beyond carnivore where people divide up over some interpretation in their religion and spit forth a new congregation.  I like that sweet spot of 87% fat and logging macros, but there was a time when I just said "YOLO! Anything goes!  Now gimme that basket of wings and a tall glass of heavy whipping cream!"

So these supplements are not from an animal.  But in the spirit of carnivore, they're not a significant source of sugar.  I'm not interested in being legalistic in this faith, but I do want proof in my pudding.  And I recognize that outside of a handful of days, most of these past 270 days in a row on Carnivore, I've taken a daily supplement:  coffee.  So, I'm adding to the list, doing what I've already done. 

Notice that I'm NOT taking a multivitamin;  it's just unnecessary.  Wonderful meat is LOADED with vitamins.  When I was a vegan, you better believe I had to take a B-complex before I found Total Whole Grain Cereal.  Once upon a time, this was my diet:

**Breakfast Smoothie (post-workout)**

* Soybeans, 6.7 oz
* Flax seed, 4 tbsp
* Cinnamon, 1 tsp
* Coffee, 16 oz
* Cacao Powder, 2 tbsp
* Total Whole Grain Cereal, 0.5 oz
* Sunflower seeds, 0.5oz
* Original No Salt Alternative, 1/4 tsp
* iodine supplement

**Lunch**

* Frozen broccoli, 6 oz
* Frozen spinach, 6 oz
* Eggs, 2

**General**

* Coffee, 5 cups

Yes, an uninspiring, RDA-checked-off, 1006 kcal march into starvation.

July 25's life below 200 lbs?

* A can of sardines
* A half-package of beef liver
* Nearly a half package of bacon
* Almost a couple of sticks of butter
* 4 cups of coffee
* Seasoning: 1¼ tsp of potassium chloride a tsp of cayenne, ½ tsp of salt, ½ tsp of black pepper

I'm making a shift with my carnivore to focus on very enriching (and cheap) selections.  It's more than a ground beef and eggs approach; I want beef liver to be a starter.  Back to the Future to the max!

Beef liver has GOT to be one of the most healthy foods in the world.  I just ran this by ChatGPT and this is the response I got:

>**How Beef Liver Ranks Among the World's Most Nutrient-Dense Foods**
>  
>**Mussels**
  - **Protein:** ~8 grams per ounce
  - **Rich in B Vitamins:** Excellent source of vitamin B12, riboflavin, and folate.
  - **Other Nutrients:** High in iron, selenium, and omega-3 fatty acids.
>  
> **Beef Heart**
  - **Protein:** ~7 grams per ounce
  - **Rich in B Vitamins:** High in CoQ10, vitamin B12, riboflavin, and niacin.
  - **Other Nutrients:** Contains significant amounts of iron and zinc.
> 
> **Sardines (with bones)**
  - **Protein:** ~6.7 grams per ounce
  - **Rich in B Vitamins:** Good source of vitamin B12, niacin, and riboflavin.
  - **Other Nutrients:** High in omega-3 fatty acids, calcium, and vitamin D.
> 
> **Beef Liver**
  - **Protein:** ~6.5 grams per ounce
  - **Rich in B Vitamins:** Extremely high in vitamin A, B12, riboflavin, folate, and niacin.
  - **Other Nutrients:** Contains iron, copper, and zinc.
> 
> **Oysters**
  - **Protein:** ~6 grams per ounce
  - **Rich in B Vitamins:** Excellent source of vitamin B12, riboflavin, and niacin.
  - **Other Nutrients:** High in zinc, iron, and selenium.
> 
> These foods are considered among the top based on their exceptional nutrient profiles, providing a rich source of essential vitamins, minerals, and high-quality protein.

I gave it a follow-up question asking, "Which of these gives the widest range of vitamins and minerals?"

"Beef Liver."

Gotta agree with [Dr. Ken Berry's take on liver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUp3G6XWEvM).

And the price?  Sardines is $0.98 a can.  Beef liver is a dollar or more LESS per pound than the cheapest ground beef.  $2.58 or something?  Superior nutrition and budget-friendly, this carnivore way of life is inviting.

*Especially* when a ribeye comes my way...

But again, proof is in the pudding.  And we'll just see just where I'm at on Facebook come New Year's Eve.  I think I have [a song that's about that...](https://open.spotify.com/track/58XWGx7KNNkKneHdprcprX)
