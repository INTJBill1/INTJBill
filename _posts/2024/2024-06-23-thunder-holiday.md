I achieved it: Day 238.  My next target? 

Break my dependence on coffee.  THIS is challenging as it's the carrier of my butter, the principal way in which I empower my high-fat carnivore approach.  I've had moderate success in the past using unsalted Kerrygold butter mixed with hot water over ice, but that's not a cost-effective answer.  That said, I get the sense I am beginning to feel *weird* from coffee.  The first two-cup coffee in a 40 oz stein is fine, but the second set has been challenging to drink...makes me feel... dehydrated...and around 3 each day, I just feel *green*.  I may be evolving beyond coffee.  A great aspect of a diet that inherently is an elimination diet is that I can see EXACTLY what affects me—like that time I gained 50lbs literally by drinking quarts of heavy whipping cream!

In money matters, as of yesterday, I officially have NO credit cards.  I know, how un-American of me!  [According to Experian](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/state-of-credit-cards/#s5), *my* Gen X peers have almost as much credit card debt per person as millennials and Gen Z COMBINED.  Along with agreeing with Dave Ramsey's advice, there's a certain *simplicity* element to not having a credit card.  

And I seek a simpler life.  

I found a video that compels me to rethink [my writing voice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ru0pnAnq7g).

I am *glad* the summer solstice has passed.  Throughout my 40s, I have been thinking summer is the *worst*.  And I always thought summer is the one season that could kill ya.  And this is from the guy who wrote that 1℉ outdoors, house heat out, frozen hot waterline of Christmas Eve 2022's [*Grandma Got Runover by a (Pork Belly)*](/2022-12-24-grandma-got-runover/)!  We can keep bundling up, but you just cannot set a big ol' ice cube outside to cool off. 

I like that the night is returning, minute-by-minute.  I miss the cascade of stars, for this city does not afford the night sky.  Once upon a time, it was [*A Sky Full of Stars.*](https://open.spotify.com/track/0FDzzruyVECATHXKHFs9eJ?si=778387e4e6ab44ac) 

The thing about improving physical and financial fitness; writing more effectively; longing to cool my tongue with a cold front; or just a sky full of dreams, they're all vehicles, not destinations.

~~If I'm going to be honest,~~ I don't know where I am going.  I know where I want to be.
