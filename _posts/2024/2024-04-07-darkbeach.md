Today is the start of a new kind of week, a shift away from the known into the foreign forests of the unknown.  I again take up the struggle in absorbing a mindset of looking back over the panoply of my life and gladly embracing and encouraging change and growth.  

A passive life is no life to live.  Sometimes we hide away on a beach with a trembling pitcher of mojito, don't we?  Sometimes we endure to *just* check the day off the Franklin Plannerâ€”*just* survive the day as the wave swells from a furious tempest on the horizon.  That's not the way *I* want to live my life.  What am I waiting for?  *That* beach now becomes my beachhead.

We have to keep moving.
