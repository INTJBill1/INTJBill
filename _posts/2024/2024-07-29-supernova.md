As I am penning this diary entry, my site just exists in a text editor.  I mean, if you gussy VS Code up, you could call this thing a "code editor" that lingers around the Integrated Development Environment store.

But, it feels like I have just a bunch of text docs...years and years of text docs! I could go back to 1989 on my XT clone running DOS 4 and you could read these words.  Uncompressed, you'd have to store all 2.8 MB of this site on the front and back of EIGHT 5.25" floppy diskettes.  I'm assuming my 11 year old self had access to the typical 360 KB ones instead of the 1.2 MB.
