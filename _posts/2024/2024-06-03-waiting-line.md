In what you see?  
Motionless wheel  
Nothing is real  
Wasting my time  
In the waiting line

Since the walking dead overtook me back in winter, I have been waiting.  I have not engaged in those 3 AM lifting sessions or 4 AM walks.  I have lost around 30 lbs since then, but those are not a function of *that* anyway.  I do miss my soundtrack from that time.  It is not 
Atlanta Rhythm Section and Journey echoing in my head, but [*Shape of You*](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=xTvyyoF_LZY&si=o9IeqvAmz8SEMH8t) and [*One in a Million*](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=kkIG5tddy9U&si=36R6O8wGh-gdayBp) pulling me like a magnet to those pre-dawn hours.

Weightloss itself is a waiting around game.  With what I do now, I don't plateau.  There is no non-existential threat to it; there are no nachos or Taco Bell cravings.  Mostly, I find eating a chore, just a macro checkbox to mark off.  I know if I wait long enough, I'll reach my goal.

No, the waiting I am experiencing is more than that.  It is more than waiting for that mid-February, vitality-draining Dementor to temper down.  In fact, I am waiting for *more*, *beyond* fitness.  

And I gotta think that this phase of my life is a time of preparation...to add wrenches into this ol' toolbox handed down the generations.  Pursue it with passion and purpose. 

I know I am coming up upon a threshold.  As sung in my #1 song a few years back, "I can feel it, coming in the air tonight."
