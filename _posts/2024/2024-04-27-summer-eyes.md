These days fall off the calendar into a stack of tedium, but my heart drives along the river in a sunset through retrowave hues.  I have hope before me of *something* on the horizon, a shift of life, a genesis of who I always was; once, a glimmer could be seen back when I was unrecognizable. 

Those years pining for Memphis were for naught.  The walking dead overran its streets long ago.  But, I *knew* Neil Diamond's streets and Marc Cohn's walks are yellowed portraits in a musty book housed within the Pink Palace of my mind's eye.  And yet, the roar of a crowd at the Liberty Bowl with the sound of the siren's call of a rumbling train wrangled my heart toward a past that rails brightly through the shadows. 

I ride my yesteryear's steel stallion of thunder beneath halos of street lamps.  "Look at these passing, purple frames!  No, no they are not thereâ€”not the way they were!  If you could only see..."  I fill in the missing lines from memory.  "No, tomorrow is the past of my days."

> We have mostly wasted time  
Half-asleep and have-to-buy    
Waiting for the faintest lie    
And waiting for these wounds to heal    
No, we're never as lost or as found as we think we are
