The results are in: **6.17%** or 14 lbs.

I haven't lost that high of a percentage in six-weeks in without the benefit of the waterloss associated with carbs or after a weight gain since...let's reel back the years, 2019 in *The 9th Expedition.*  And yeah, that was on that horrible semi-starving diet of 1000-1200 kcal a day, compared to today's satiating ~2300.  And I did it on *nearly* 20 lbs of butter.

Zounds, man, simply ZOUNDS!

Today's weigh-in blew my predictions out of the water—I guess I really ought to return to my old ways!  It just made sense to be around the 4.5% range—not the nearly 6.2%!  In fact, last night, I only lost ¾" around my waist thus breaking my streak of dropping a jeans size for every six-weeks.

The funny thing is that *37E's* macros and fat kcal % μ is [nearly identical](/fit/#intake) with *36E* (while the specifics are NOT).
