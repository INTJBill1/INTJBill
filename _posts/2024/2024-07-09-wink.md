(Neal McCoy's [*Wink*](https://open.spotify.com/track/3VffiMehjhfqo7XZ5zGpCP) was the #1 country song this time 30 years ago in '94.  It was preceded by Brooks and Dunn's [*That Ain't No Way to Go*](https://open.spotify.com/track/79qohYpwFioUp2Gq0QHVKa) and was followed by Travis Tritt's [*Foolish Pride*](https://open.spotify.com/track/1glgtwyZNhpv9vEFLlLdbl).  Sometime in that time frame, I owned my first CD-ROM drive, for I specifically remember playing the Travis's album for which that one came off of, *Ten Feet Tall and Bulletproof*.)

July 8th came and went.  On some level, it was an instrumental day.  Oh, perhaps it is not like what occurred thirty years ago when I drove by myself for the first time up to the Raleigh Springs Mall and purchased my first pair of cowboy boots for $150. 

Then again, perhaps it was...

At any rate, I made it through my sardine approach.  And lemme tell ya, I DO NOT like Chicken of the Sea's take on the sardine!  It's that whole slurp-up-the-tail aspect that's so offputting...well, and perhaps the slime, too.

Now Walmart's Great Value offering is pretty chunky in size and comes off like tuna.  It is better and cheaper!  Dust it with a good sprinkling of Redmond's and you've got yourself something.  While Chicken of the Sea had me worried about the long haul ahead, I can totally do sardines like Walmart's for the next 41 days.  I didn't feel like I finished a lifting set after I went through a can, unlike the three this morning that I completed by sheer force of will.

For more info on why I am doing this, I thought this Dr. Boz video does a decent job, [*Kickstart Metabolism In 3 Days With Sardines*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhipbos4eUU).

Even ol' Dr. Ken Berry from just down the road has a take in [*#1 Healthy FISH You Should Eat (Low Mercury!)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShscWIsRoE) that just makes sense.

After The 40th Expedition, I'll open a weekday or two to sardines.
