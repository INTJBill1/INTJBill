The post I wrote earlier for today was on the tail end of last night.  It actually was one LONG post with the day prior.  Thus, this time-sensitive one is being written around midday today (and 4 hours later...).  

I have made some U-turns!

## Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes

1. **No Sardines**. The 40th Expedition sardine focus has ended.  I can do it, but it takes WAY too much willpower to maintain.  Into the 4th day, I gladly tap out and will embrace beef with open arms tomorrow.  This decision was influenced by today's yardwork as I walked past death's threshold.  Nothing says you shouldn't have a belly full of sardines like standing in the sun wearing black head-to-toe. Being exhausted and dragging yourself indoors in that state THEN burping up sardine acid, well, that's gotta be a low point!  Well, that and getting stung by a hornet in the back of your shaved head.

Something I scowled toward: as I pushed that stupid, non-powered self-propelled drive chain through thick, wet grass is that my fitness blows monkey chunks.  And while I *tried* to save battery usage, those suckers dried up before I finished the front yard.  So, I outlasted the tech?  
<br>
While it was hours ago, I remain saddled with something shaky in my chest.  Not a 1st place trophy day!  Quick thought: I regret throwing out those old Taekwondo trophies from the 90s.  ["I close my eyes and slip away."](https://open.spotify.com/track/1QEEqeFIZktqIpPI4jSVSF)

2. **"Whoa Oh Whoa Listen to the Music."** Spotify and music references are back:  I tried to go without, but I sorely missed it in today's yardwork.

3. **Coffee**.  Yes, my body is dependent on the stuff. Cutting it in half one day and then going cold turkey the next is totally Marilyn Manson and the Sneaker Pimps' [*Long Hard Road Out of Hell*](https://open.spotify.com/track/0dbHkhT1wug159VR0SJCkQ) (1997) And while my stress levels for the past 3 days were in the 30s, one time I looked down at my watch and it was reminiscent to those earlier days with the zombie bite; that sucker was up to 98! 
<br><br>
And hey, Dr. Berry gives the thumbs-up: [*Is COFFEE bad for you? The (Truth about Coffee)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69kXcsl0NgA).

4. **Props to Tim McGraw, thumbs down to the Beatles**.  I need to get myself out there on venues like Facebook.  You can't be a friend a friend would like to have by hiding your love away.  Plus, how am I gonna invite folks to the gun show if nobody's in attendance?

## What Now?

Ok, so we've got beef back on board, music, coffee, and a New Year's Eve connection: what are we gonna roll on?

### DnD

I'm bringing back my Dungeons & Dragons character sheet for daily workouts.  OK, so I don't have it; it was something I built in Google Sheets.  But, I'll whip something together in [LibeWriter or LibreCalc](https://www.libreoffice.org/).  Hey, why not my 2005-2006 goto, [Scribus](https://wiki.scribus.net/canvas/Scribus)?

I didn't realize how chockful of content my morning training once was!  Dexterity (agility), strength, and stamina!  I never did complete the sheet with the other three, charisma, intelligence, and wisdom.  

And while I attempted to create a training regimen of just three exercises, bench press, Arnold press, and dumbbell rows, it was a mistake.  It's more engaging to have Back, Chest, Legs/Core, Shoulders, and Arms days.

While I love my 10,944 target, I want a weekly step up to my steps.  Kelly Hogan's daily target is 30,000, a plane I have walked a few times, but not something I can maintain.  To hit that kind of target, you gotta be moving all day.  

### Taekwondo

Yes, once upon a time I was a quasi- black belt, a *First Degree Recommended Black Belt*.  Yeah, in practice I sparred against 1st to 4th degrees.  I'd assess my skill level was on par with the 2nd degrees, though my strength never relied on my kicks, but my hand techniques.  I really owe that to my training from ages 14-17 as a boxer from my Marine/Pro boxer dad.  Of course, at 17, I did wrestling and later TKD, making me a mixed martial artist before that was a thing.  

I regret I never did the testing to remove the "Recommended" part of my degree.  It's pure vanity, of course.  I was very much a black belt, but I never took the time to train again in the earlier patterns to ensure I could do it on cue for the test.  I suppose it was 1998 and other things got into my schedule.  

I am going to go back and train through the patterns I once did, well, the ITF ones, from Chon-Ji to Kwang-Gae, not the made-up ones that the master of my federation devised.

And I have NO memory of the karate katas I learned from the tutelage of Mr. Mullen, now the [Nevada Athletic Commission executive director](https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2021/11/mma-news-bob-bennett-retirement-nevada-state-athletic-commission-jeff-mullen).  But, I only spent a year in karate at ages 18-19 anyway.

And in time, I will move on to first degree, second degree, and so forth.  The Internet allows me to do this.  There was a time, I had to buy a VHS cassette just to grab the color belt patterns.  The black belt patterns were all hush-hush.  When I was white, yellow, green, blue, and sometimes red, I used to go in early just to watch the black belts train together, so I could visualize the spirit of their training.  I recognized the patterns even if I never wrote the movements down.

I raise the question, "Why integrate this into my training?"  Yes, it builds strength and improves agility.  For those reasons alone, it's green-lit.  But, it's also *movement*. Practical, primal movement.  While lifting weight is a conduit of resistance, it is not realistic to life, unless of course you work at a gym or work as a fitness store stocker.  Martial arts is about how to move YOUR body in space with confidence and accuracy.  You won't find that at the gym, arms locked along a rubberband trajectory.

### Primal

I've referenced it before, but I also want to have a daily "primal" regimen.  Maybe it could be viewed as a warmup...or a *primal primer!*

10 pushups  
10 Asian/primal squats  
10 planks  
10 situps  

Just 1 set. Nothing too extravagant.  Just something to get me prepped for the day.  I don't even know yet how long to hold the squats and planks.

### Tech

I want to bring in tools to aid in whirling this machine up.  Two things I want to make a return:

1. [**UFC Fight Pass**](https://welcome.ufcfightpass.com/region/row). Watching UFC fights has been my thing since June 2018.

2. **A Google account**. "Shazbot!  But, you've got your own email?  You HATE Google.  You use Brave Search!"  To better use all of the features of my degoogled phone, like I dunno, GOOGLE PLAY SERVICES, I gotta play with Google.  I cannot use my Garmin app on my phone, but have to do updates via USB and do my steps sync manually with a direct connection to WiFi.  While I don't see myself using it for email, I was thinking about transitioning to a CloudFlare host later this year and not renewing my email subscription to Tuta to save a few bucks before March 2025.

3. **ChatGPT**.  I am plopping down $20/m for a subscription to ChatGPT.  It's proven itself; it's my workbench.  While $20 is inflated, I can justify 67 cents a day.
