My carnivore streak has reached 150 days.  5 months!  And once again, scurvy never set in. ğŸ¤ª  This diesel locomotive keeps rumbling along.

The thing is, I faced a lot of personal unknowns on that first voyage in carnivore, ESPECIALLY since I was once SUPPLEMENTS-TO-THE-MAX guy.  These days, I know I can trust it as [a species-appropriate diet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYRUCx7Bj08).  Sure, in lean times we can gnaw on tree bark and leaves, but we were more satisfied when we hunted with our dogs or netted fish.

When I survey the past 5 months, how *strange* it is to reflect on how I once found it difficult to return to this lifestyle!  Profound is the addiction of carbsâ€”sugar can be VERY enticing!

My Wednesday/Sunday Fat Focus days experiment continues.  Unlike last time, The 37th Expedition ought to give better insight toward the impact of having a couple days where I bump 87% to 98-99% calories from fat.  I actually up the amount on those days as well, though its generally in the neighborhood of 250 grams, so it's not a statistically significant change in calories.  As such, I would not label it as *metabolic confusion*.  But, I'm definitely throwing my body a curve ball!  And yet on those days, I can *feel* I am missing the protein.  

Incidentally, I *never* miss sugars.  I make up the next day (and the preceding) by feeling free to bump up the protein beyond 75.  And I look forward to tomorrow morning when I reward myself with a filet of salmon!

As to my other fitness categories, while experientially, it's just another day, I seem to have returned a few plates to the rack regarding my persistent fatigue.  Yesterday, I pushed the ol' mower across both the front and back yards.  Not that my chest did not flutter, but there was an increased stamina capacity.  Just not enough to continue with the weedwacker.  I can now also stand up and fry up bacon fully and not settle!

My legs are also lighter.  Sometimes, I feel like I can step up on air.  My kicks have greater snap and control.  But, I suspect that's more of a function of continued weightloss, especially as these particular 38" pants either demand a hand or a pair of suspenders.  And yes, today is an Alaskan belt buckle day...and you KNOW I'm snapping suspenders against these long-sleeved black shirts!
