This morning's walk @4:15 AM had a truckload of promise:  59℉ with a persistent wind just fit organically into my Thundercast persona.  Is this the mornings that will follow?  Is this spring 2024? 

As I walked, the wind swirled around me.  I felt the draw of the miles that lay ahead.  I recognized that this morning was *special*.  The temperatures will drop tonight and begin their descent into the teens and single digits this upcoming week.  But, *this* is a special moment in time.  While I have been training at a windchill factor in the 20s, I don't know if I have the appropriate gear for anything below that—I could very well have to shelve my outdoor approach for a week. 

But alas, I only put 2 miles in.  I've had the fortune to experience specific pain from across both feet—you name it: top, bottom, inner, outer—but, I've just walked it off.  But today was different.  The midfoot sole of my right foot had the occasional hot surge that even now makes me get lost in it.

Clearly, the attrition of achieving and exceedingly by a large margin for 20-going-on-21 days straight has come a'callin'. 

Sitting here with my leg propped up, this predicament irritates me.  I've settled into a good rhythm and lovin' the routine.  I am building a body I have never possessed.  And BAM—this zinging pain, the kind of thing that has happened time and again, those times sidelineing for months–is *this* the setback?  

Do I pull out the crutches again?  Is the momentum fumbled away? Is it over?  Am I gone?  Is 2024 just another wasted year?

No, as it has been sung, ["When I'm gone, I'm never really gone."](https://open.spotify.com/track/5902W4uHWzhtOff1UK7the?si=3fb6be279694460b)  I hope this foot thing is a passing gimmick, just a brief scenic tour off the main road.  As to my 2024, nothing has changed.  By year end, [*Heads Will Roll*](https://open.spotify.com/track/18oWEPapjNt32E6sCM6VLb?si=edb3effc871d4ee1).
