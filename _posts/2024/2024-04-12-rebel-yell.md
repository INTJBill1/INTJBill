It's *liver* Friday!  OK, so I'm developing a day schema that's kicking off for *The 38th Expedition*:

* *fat focus* SUNDAY
* *fish* MONDAY
* *"nothing! absolutely nothing! you're so stupid!"* TUESDAY
* *fat focus* WEDNESDAY
* *fish* THURSDAY
* *liver* FRIDAY
* *steak* SATURDAY

Before the bustle of the day, the environment was around 50℉ with 60% humidity at the 6 AM hour.  How my heart *yearned* to move in and around the University of Memphis campus again!

Movement is important, of course; dreaming is critical.  That's what I do when I go for my long walks, imagine a world to be, a futurescape.   

I have not moved in *The 37th Expedition*—just one walking day and one lifting session.  That was it!  My take?  On Sunday, I'll weigh in and find that I lost 4.5% and miss out on how daily training gives me an additional 1%.  Thus, I don't get that extra 2¼ lbs and I don't hit that target of 215.  

But, it ain't Sunday yet!  Since about the start of November, I have lost about 60 lbs because I see butter and "With a rebel yell, (I cry), 'More, more, more,' wow!" While unlikely, it is *possible* I could be sub-200 lbs by next month's Memorial Day.  

Yesterday, I packed away the clothes I wore at the start of this adventure.  They fit some other guy.  Admittedly, I felt nostalgic when I grabbed my pullover that protected me in all of those 20-something mornings in walks to Starbucks and my old Piggly Wiggly, chasing the ghosts of my past down forgotten roads.
