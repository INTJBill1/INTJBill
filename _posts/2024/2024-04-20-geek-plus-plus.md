It is another STEAK Saturday!  I had 8.3 oz of thinly sliced ribeye from ALDI.  As an additional treat, I had 1.5 oz of Buc-ees' original pork rinds from across the state.  The thing I like best about 'em is that there was none of that hard stuff that cracks molars, unlike the fresh stuff over at ol' Casa Perez Market.

Steak is so incredibly *invigorating*.  It makes these days something very special  And it's a cinch to throw the thin cuts into an air fryer, too!

I am shifting my approach to this website, crafting it toward my own proclivities, namely, weightloss, but in a digital context.

* Removed:
    * All single-use images
    * All iframe embeds, some 300 files worth!
    * Google Charts
* Returned GZIP backups to the size equivalent of a 3.5" floppy diskette

Yes, this website is *screaming* fast, ESPECIALLY compared to those old WordPress installs I used to run.  Just look at this site's source and compare it with stuff out there!  But, even then, the code isn't indented the way I'd prefer.  Slappin' the areas of the page together can get messy.  

It just didn't make sense to use Google Charts.  My data change what, once every 42 days?  As good as I am, I don't lose weight in a live context!  Static images are fine to tell the story.  However, an image for a single post?  Well, used today then bird cage liner the next—it don't make a bit of sense, does it?  Remember that AI narrating a post?  That took a ton of space, 2.6 MB!  "You're outta here, toaster!"

As to all the iframes: in a way, iframes are a throwback to a simpler time.  It is reminiscent of frames, back when people wanted a wieldable nav, both readily viewable and easy to update. That sort of thing would *never* survive today's ridiculously small screens of phones.  

More importantly, I don't approve of things like Google's tracking on YouTube embeds.  I should NOT have to block elements on my own website!  I'm the only guy out who simply does not care about SEO.  I'd rather drive website traffic off a cliff!  

Yes, I am breaking from my reliance on Google.  As I removed all the embeds over the years, I could not help but notice how wadding up the doodles has been a goal of mine.  So, I left.  

Unlike in the past, my leaving did not take much.  While my cloud subscription expires in June, I have been hesitant to pull the trigger because of the $140 annual fee I spent in February for YouTube Premium, largely just so that I am not pestered by ads when I cast to the TV, something completely avoidable with an HDMI output.  To complete the transition, I have added a *new* New Year's Resolution!  I'm still rolling with those, folks!

Most importantly, I have decommissioned my Spotify account AND I do not have the YouTube Music fallback option, either.  You'll see the shift in this space.

Upon other matters, I'm looking forward to a delivery tomorrow, my very own [*It's a Saturday Night*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgkVGqsRbAM) shirt [(Amazon link)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KQ1WF8K)!  I know, it's a simple thing.  Honestly, it just reminds me of how my wardrobe in 2023 was not much beyond a pair of shorts and a T-shirt.

And I'm gonna do more pursuits that require these [Daddy Can't See](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUe5WVf8Drc) glasses of mine.  And you KNOW that's gonna be geek to the max—doin' it since 1987 at age 9, just a couple of years away from the monthly computer club meetings at State Tech.

By the way, isn't this [Weird Al bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPAlmXHMktA) marvelous?
