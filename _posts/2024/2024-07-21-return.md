There is something about a Saturday night. It draws me back to nearly three decades ago, to yesteryear.  It's a kind of magic, something with hints of adventure.  I feel it again; I am on the verge of something exciting.

I signed up for the cologne subscription service, [Scentbird](https://www.scentbird.com/).  While the idea has been in my head for months, I pulled the trigger after watching another Matt video, [*Great Value Freezer Section vs. The Real Thing*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVHuJO8ePAs).  My queue:

**July**

1. Tommy Bahama's [Maritime Triumph](https://www.scentbird.com/perfume/tommy-bahama-maritime-triumph-1840) - *pimento berries, cedar leaf, cashmere wood, violet leaves, mandarin oil*
2. Confessions of a Rebel's [Better Than Your Ex](https://www.scentbird.com/perfume/confessions-of-a-rebel-better-than-your-ex-3354) - *black pepper, apple, Italian lemon, lavender, sandalwood*

**August** 

1. Tru Western's [Yellowstone Ride](https://www.scentbird.com/perfume/true-western-yellowstone-ride-3499) - *raw bergamot, crisp clary sage, smoked whiskey, charred vanilla, rough cut tobacco*
2. Room 1015's [Ten Fifteen](https://www.scentbird.com/perfume/room-1015-ten-fifteen-1540) - *sandalwood, mandarins, saffron, iris, violet*

I nearly went with Verasce's Eros again; but, I've worn that scent so there's no discovery. I would like to explore its leather colognes.

Perhaps big picture, it matters none as to what I wear.  But, I cannot deny that it makes me feel good. This fragrance fellowship also coincides to the very beginning of 2021 as I was still in the country, seeing the changes ahead and grasping toward places on the scale I hadn't been since...music was good.  As I would later write in that year:

> NOW on THIS day in history, I weigh in under 200 lbs. At 197.5, I am the lightest I have been in 16 years! And five of those years had me well above the 300 lb mark!
>
> It's surreal to finally return to this place—it's like I hitched a ride on the DeLorean.
>
> August 12, 2021

Just think about it: just last week, I weighed in at 199.  How do I feel?  

> I'm a man on fire  
Sounds crazy but I never lose  
Oh you know I'm gonna give it  
All I got do what i came to do  
I'm a man on fire  
And my day is overdue  
This burn is never gonna stop  
Do what I came to do  
I'm a man on fire

> Oh the Larceny, [Man on Fire](https://open.spotify.com/track/5f86pwm0xHX09PgGcvu2F0) (2018)

My workouts kick off tomorrow to make a push toward that NYR golden ratio.

Along with the return of training, on Saturday, I returned to two things, the ever-inspiring BACON, you'll recall these musical blog post titles:

1. The 29E Weigh-in: "Bacon, I Was Made For Lovin' You"

2. "...but It Ain't No Lie, Baby, Buy Buy Buy"

3. "Bacon, You're Simply the Best, Better Than All the Rest"

4. "All Around the World, Bacon Crumbles for Me. Who Knows How Long I've Loved You?"

5. "All You Bacon Can't You See, Can't You See, How Your Love's Affecting My Vitality"

6. "The Things You Weigh—Cure Unbelievable!"

7. "Here Come the Bacon Fat, Meat Won't Let You Remember..."

8. "I Got That Bovine on My Docket, Got That Bacon on My Sheet"

9. "I Wanna Really, Really, Really Wanna Cure-A-Pig, Ah"

10. Harbor Freight Trip 01 of 2023: "I Wish I Cooked Ribeye Into a Stir Fry...I Want to Fry Away"

11. "I've Flamed Every Grill I Suppose...Bacon, I Have Found, I Get Lost in You"

12. "Test Your Might. Chortle Porkfat! Bite!"

13. "Turn the Beef to Brown, Love to Seer My Obsession"

14. "When It's Over, That's the Time I Maul and Shove Bacon."

15. "So Tonight, I Wanna Hearty Steak—It's Dine Scene Mighty Fine!"

16. "Do Want to Choose It. It’s a Salt Lick! Bacon Woogie, Woogie!"

17. "Plumper to Plumper, the Barbecue’s Stacked...Thrice Spice, Maybe? Too Bold! Chew Gold."

18. "I Won't Apply Part, Hibachi à la Carte. Adjust Donut—Sink It in the Sand!"

19. "Fruit Carbohydrate Win—A Plied Girth Score Chart, Not Loss in the Game"

20. "And I’m Too Messy for My Lamb, Too Messy for Bacon in Jackson or Milan—I Like to Gobble, You Know What I Mean?"

21. "There's a Fryer Goin' on Right Here, an Immolation to Fast Chew All the Steers"

22. "Bacon Come Back...I Was Wrong and I Just Can't Live Without You"

There's just may be underlying love for bacon there!

And then there is 2018's passion for cayenne.  In 2018, I took supplements of it and 2019, I had my dehydrated spinach, brocoli, and flaxseed cracker-abominations covered with the stuff.  I had AI drum up a ratio for black pepper : salt : cayenne for a burger rub: 2:2:1.  I scooped out 10 tablespoons of black pepper, 10 of Redmond's course salt (I still have probably around 24 lbs from [this purchase](https://redmond.life/products/real-salt-coarse-grind-bulk-bag-25-lb?variant=18296779440195)), and added 5 tbsps of cayenne.
