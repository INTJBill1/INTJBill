The results for The 40th Expedition are in: **-4.5%** or -9 lbs.  

At 193 lbs, I am below the 200 lb threshold.  I could've tacked another 5 lbs to that total, and skip the 190s entirely, but it would have been unearned.

Closing out this Expedition has not been normal.  Nausea kept me from holding anything down for a couple of days.  Water fasting followed that up for the four days thereafter.

And then there was the cascade of medications.

I spent about 4 days in the ICU this past week because of a [STEMI heart attack](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22068-stemi-heart-attack).  

I have much to unpack from this experience and will do so in these gaps where the medications do not dull my writing.  At the time, I remain on this earth...the prospect of eternity is very tangibly just around the bend.  May we always hold that perspective.

In the meantime, I've got Tomlin's [*Our God*](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=R-JZ9KsI7YI&si=d19F0n0-fUzTc_tZ) (2010) and David Crowder Band's album [*Illuminate*](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nlxOYXuGqhsW1wssl3JOfZVP12A78j-ZQ) (2003) in my head.
