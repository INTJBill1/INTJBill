While I walked in the rain the other day, yesterday morning was the first time I did the windy, slanted rain variety.  It was a quiet experience and I wonder if it ever happened.  I mean, it was only 45 minutes, but it was a 45 minutes that stood outside of time.  And maybe that's what I love about that 4 AM hour, that everything I do is outside the typical machinations of the world.  There is no one and the world is my own.  There's no corridor of air formed in the wake of traffic.  There is but the moon and the long call of the night train. 

At 8 miles, I thought Friday's longest walk of 2024 was going to stand for some time.  But no, it was snapped a couple of day's later with this morning's unplanned 8.4-mile trek.  

This year is about that, setting marks and beating them.  Today at 25.9K, I'm in line-of-sight of January 3rd's all-time 2nd place 31.2K steps.  I'd like to take that today. January 2019 #1's ~50,000 is safe for today.  However, that will go down in 2024.

I just feel really good with the direction I am going in. I don't know if I'll hit my moonshot goal for this year, that Ï†, but my spirit roars to capture it.  I don't think of next month or next weighin.  I think of New Year's Eve.

And all of this is in a context that demands a green headlamp...
