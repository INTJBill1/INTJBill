categories:

The results are in: **-4.23%** or -9 lbs.

On its face, I am not happy with these results.  It snapped a streak of 9 consecutive double-digit weight losses on my High-fat Carnivore diet.  And it is the lowest negative percentage in three years (September 2021).

It is still a success, but perhaps it should have been much more.  Or I am lamenting that I am *so close* to that 200 lb threshold!

## Why, Oh, Why?

I set out food targets and hit them exactly. Honestly, I cannot find a correlation to my weightloss success to even make an adjustment.  Take a look at [my intake table](fit/#ships-stores).  What's the relative positive correlation?!  I have been lamenting the *too low* protein numbers as halfway through I saw it was a problem.

I let ChatGPT 4 take a crack at my data and the excerpt is below.  I exclude 28E and 34E because they benefit from the carb withdrawal bump.

> **Conclusion:**
> 
> When excluding 28E and 34E, the strongest positive correlations with weight loss percentage appear to be with:
>
> * **Butter (lbs):** Higher butter consumption correlates with greater weight loss.
>
> * **Broth (gallons):** Increased broth consumption also correlates with better weight loss percentages.
> 
> * **Coffee (gallons):** There is a noticeable but less consistent positive correlation with coffee consumption.
>
> Overall, butter and broth consumption show the most consistent positive correlations with weight loss percentage.

Further evidence how calories don't *count*: these are the daily calorie numbers for ALL of my HFC Expeditions, and no, I didn't track them at all:

### HFC #1 Calories

* 28E: 2253	
* 29E: 2111	- *Most Bacon: 9.5 lbs! 2nd Least Butter: 10.1 lbs!*
* 30E: 2162	
* 31E: 2310	
* 32E: 2307

### HFC #2 Calories

* 34E: 2102
* 35E: 2367	
* 36E: 2266	
* 37E: 2243	
* 38E: 2361 - *Most Butter: 22.4 lbs! 2nd Least Bacon: 1.7 lbs!*

Both combined is 60 weeks worth!

## The Takeaway

All that aside, there's this weird bit:

In The 37th, I lost 6.17% and trimmed ¾" around my gut.  In The 38th, I lost 4.24% and hacked off 1 ¾"–more than double!  *\*shrug\**

Perhaps my 235-gram fat target burns fat more effectively, even if my Google Charts' playground slides are not as intense.

As to how this syncs up with my New Year's Resolutions:

* I can now squeeze into 34" jeans for a one-and-done wear—I'm all about my black polyester!
* My shoulders-to-waist ratio is close to 1.1, though that 1.6 seems like a good NYR for '25
* My arms dropped an inch! Dag burn it.
