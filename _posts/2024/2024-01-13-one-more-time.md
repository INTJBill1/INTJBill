As there's no lifting on Saturday, I added the extra hour to my recovery regimen which is critical to this—well, both feet.  Neither shoes nor concrete are kind to them.  At a 21℉ windchill, it would be on the fringes of what I'm comfortable to thrive on with my typical combination of a workout thermal, short-sleeved compression shirt, and 94% polyester t-shirt guarding my core.

As I look ahead to this week's weather, it's going to give me the opportunity to hone my strength workout and add a couple of other foci that adopt from my history with taekwondo, karate, yoga, etc.  Body movement!  I'm starting to think that my mid-December push to incorporate line dancing and Napolean Dynamite for 2024 wasn't that far off—gotta get those steps in:
