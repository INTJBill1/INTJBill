Now that I'm below 200 lbs, I've upped my spice game.  I changed my rub to a 1:1:2 ratio, instead of a 2:2:1, for a total of 20 tbs of cayenne pepper into my mix.  Unfortunately, I gotta earn other spices to move beyond my *Whatta Man* pillars (salt and pepper).

This morning, I put a ¼ tsp of the rub on one side of the patty and then flipped it over and did the same.  My 2-patty breakfast with 2.3 oz of bacon was STUFFING!  That spice rub is the appetite killer.  But, to be fair, I did have my two cups of coffee with a stick-and-a-half butter.  Plus, I added back a half tbsp of bacon fat to each 85/15 burger.  I'll have another coffee later for the today with just a couple of tablespoons of butter and I'm DONE for the day: 222 / 71 / 0.6.   Yes, I even track my spices: 1 tsp = 0.5 carbs.

My traps are sore today, which amuses me because I just doddled around yesterday morning.  I only did 3 of the planned 5 sets of incline rows because my breastbone just felt like it was gonna cave in.  

After that, I then just amused myself with shrugs and crank out a few bicep curls.  It was totally not my old approach!  I'll get better.  

However, I did manage to welcome the night with arms wide open at 4 AM even though my stamina slept in.

This morning was nothing because my alarm clock / workout buddy, Garmin Forerunner 935, had its watchband snap in half as I slept?  I guess I finally learned to sleepwalk those steps in!  But, I've got a velcro update coming in today.  When it comes in, I'll train, though I want to put work in that's optimal, objective, succinct, and with purpose.  I get the sense that workouts become a flurry of activity just 'cause everyone else is doing it.  

We don't ask those questions of why.  Like ellipticals—what *exactly* am I training—other than for a move to Norway.  And what about the holy grail of squats with a barbell?  Where is the life application for *THAT?* It's just not a wrench I need in my toolbox.  Asian squats however...sign me up for those this week!

My development ranking?

1. Movement
2. Pliability
3. Strength

...or roughly in DnD/WoW terms: Constition / Stamina; Dexterity / Agility; and Strength.
