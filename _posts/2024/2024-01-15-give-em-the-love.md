Today I feel like...somewhere in the vicinity of the Smashing Pumpkins' [*Stand Inside Your Love*](https://open.spotify.com/track/3RciEQxS7PxtLqMs7OwRsU?si=382d822946aa4de2) and Terry Crews doing this:

I feel good, though my cardio regimen...has really made it possible for so much needed recovery!  Yeah, this cold weather needs to pass, though officially, it is another Alaska belt buckle day. 

So, yeah, I can't implement my daily walking that I've been doingâ€”NO Starbucks, Yell! or *St. Elmo's Fire*.  I've already hit my daily steps goal before noon.  In fact, just today here on the 15th, I earned a 300,000 steps badge for the month of January from Garmin.

I slept in to 3:15 AM, because of a misconfigured alarm.  My tardiness neither hampered my lifting session for my back nor kept me from adding new content to my morning:

1. A 15-point, bumper-to-bumper inspection of stretching;
2. a grab bag of agility

While I envision more, for now as promised, my fitness form *(media content yanked to optimize site)*, a Google Sheet rendered to PDF, inspired by the [DND 5E character sheet](https://media.wizards.com/2022/dnd/downloads/DnD_5E_CharacterSheet_FormFillable.pdf).
