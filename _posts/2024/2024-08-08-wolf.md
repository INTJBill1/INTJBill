I was delighted to see AccuRadio featured *Throwback Thursday: 1996* today.  

And I gotta admit, I ❤️ the idea of [Top 40: July 19, 1996](https://www.accuradio.com/channel/6088394fab53e3741f4fcb09).  What a great day to be alive for the class of '96!  As the world was unfurled, that time was a couple of months after high school bridging over to a new beginning of attending university.  That summer, you could see me spending my last moments at Piggly Wiggly and also spending time at the family print shop in Somerville, listening to a spotty country station out of Jackson, as I was lit up in red in my darkroom work.  

And while this radio stream is not exclusively the top 40 of that date, it is playing a song that played in my convertible in that July '96: Billie Ray Martin's *Your Loving Arms* (1995).  I used to keep *[Dance Mix USA Volume 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VANLjimGCVU)* spinning regularly in that ol' Mustang of mine, a place of the Real McCoy's *Run Away*.  I miss the energy of that time when every weekend was a mystery as to what it might entail.  I'll listen to that album and I can almost smell the air freshener I kept in that convertible.  

Was it *really* that long ago?  Aren't ya supposed to be OLD for a 30-year reunion?  Pay no attention to this gray wolf's beard—I'm more Geralt than Gandalf!

## Sardines and Me

I've got all of my glucose tests below.  I'm trying to establish the impact beef liver has on my life.  My data seem to indicate it has a significant role.

I finish eating each day by noon with my butter coffee soon finishing thereafter.

### Fasting Glucose

At 15 days in a row, today marks the last day of my sardine focus.  In time, I learned to ground it up and then crisp it on a pan with fiery cayenne.  It's far from my go-to meat. *(I mean, C'MON, it's NO bacon!)* But, it enabled me to slam through and ABSOLUTELY wreck that weightloss stall. 

And with nary a doctor or even a coach, sans the YouTube channels of [Kelly Hogan](https://www.youtube.com/@myzerocarblife) and [Dr. Ken Berry](https://www.youtube.com/@KenDBerryMD), I'm down 141 lbs.
