That didn't last long:  I flipped back to my new *old* theme.  I suppose "flipped" doesn't do me justice: I threw 3 hours into the change after hanging out with ChatGPT 4.  The time spent was only for the two Google Charts named ["Maps,"](/fit/#maps) along with some minor content updates.

See, I use CSS variables on this site.  It lets me set up the color standards on this site so that changes made then propagate everywhere.  Like, I used to love (even had memorized) [#ec1690](https://www.color-hex.com/color/ec1690), but now I run with [#ff2683](https://www.color-hex.com/color/ff2683).  Only one change is required and everything matches the update.

For example, my last theme had this:
``--black: #3F3F3F;
--white: #fcfcfc;
--gray: #e5e5e5;
--shadow: #b4b4b4;
--primary: #324d8f;
--secondary: #007bff;
--highlighter: #edfe5fb3;
--accent: #c01b2c;``

(That accent is another example of a change from a memorized #b70d00.)

Simple stuff.  But, for an explosion of color, I go from 8 variables to 16.  But Google Charts cannot directly access those site colors without declaring the variables:

1. In the Google Chart JavaScript, go ahead do that for some 15 aspects of a chart, title, gridlines et al:
``var titleColor = root.getPropertyValue('--compare__title').trim(); ``

2. And then pop this into CSS
``--compare__title: var(--neon__blue);``

Now, I could have saved that second step from happening, but I don't want a standard for my two Google Charts, but for them to stand on their own (and I want the ability to modify it at one place in the future).  So for TWO charts, I doubled the amount of variables—whew!

And thus, it was all an exercise in detail!  And now, I have the ability to ensure all the colors are what I want without running down particular files.  My site is actually in pieces; each Chart is in its own HTML file via Jekyll's [_includes functionality](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/).  And think, there was once a time when sites required PHP for such capability.  ([*Not the Future...*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9tgLnI0fFc)).

I like how although I built this website from the ground up, there is always some new customization I can drop into this muscle car.

My life hasn't been all technical this week: 

1. I pulled off the wall a breaker-tripping microwave oven from over the stove (and now I'm in the market for a vent hood).  It should have been easy, but the guy who installed it bolted the fasteners diagonally against the wall.  I had to \**thud-thud-thud\** away with my woodworking chisels to make room for their extraction.  It was the first time I've ever used a socket wrench with a screw bit. 

2. I waved around my magic multimeter to troubleshoot a bathroom light fixture.  

3. I pulled back the oven to plug this [220-to-110 adapter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08QV2VFPD) in because I got tired of seeing the gas oven's power cord snake over to the counter's outlet.  It was laughable when we moved in, because it was on a surge protector.  What—should I upgrade it with a UPS to ensure my bread isn't interrupted?
