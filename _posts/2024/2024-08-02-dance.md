This post kicks off with [1987 Classic Rock](https://www.accuradio.com/channel/4f63783e0d114065d0000269), specifically, the timeless *With or Without You* (1987). 

I've never had my blood glucose checked before, much less my ketone levels.  I can now say I've had it TWICE.  I ran the Keto-Mojo number cruncher on Thursday and this morning as soon as I woke up (5:30 AM and 2:30 AM).  I pricked my finger (ever so haltingly) and sampled my blood for both figures.  Despite my family history of diabetes, apparently my carnivore diet is right on point.

**August 1 & 2: Fasting Levels**

* **Glucose**: 68, 72
* **Ketone*s**: 4, 3.7
* **Boz ratio**: 17.0, 19.4 (deepest)

I don't need a computer to tell me that I'm in a deep state of ketosis.  But, it's good to see what I can expect with eating sardiness and a heavy load of cayenne, black pepper, and salt—4 carbs worth!

And who knows what my supplements contribute.  What I DO know is that I smell like a mix of designer cologne and turmeric. 

*(Again AccuRadio gets me: Echo & the Bunnymen's Lips Like Sugar (1987).  My mind returns to a 2019 beneath the summer song soaking the rays.)*

Yep, this ship is fat-adapted!  I mean, I really ought to be with 278 days into it.  And you can imagine my frustration when I hit that last weigh-in stall!

ChatGPT tells me this about my existing in a deep state of ketosis:

> 1. **Enhanced Fat Burning**: In deep ketosis, your body primarily burns fat for energy, which can aid in weight loss and fat loss, especially around the abdominal area.
>
>2. **Improved Mental Clarity**: Many individuals report better focus, mental clarity, and cognitive function when in deep ketosis. Ketones are a more efficient and stable source of energy for the brain.
>
> 3. **Stable Energy Levels**: With ketones as the primary energy source, you may experience more stable energy levels throughout the day without the typical energy crashes associated with carbohydrate consumption.
>
> 4. **Appetite Control**: Ketosis can lead to reduced hunger and cravings, making it easier to adhere to dietary plans and control caloric intake.
>
>5. **Improved Blood Sugar Control**: Lower and stable blood sugar levels can help manage and prevent insulin resistance, which is beneficial for individuals with type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome.
>
> 6. **Anti-Inflammatory Effects**: Ketones have anti-inflammatory properties that may help reduce inflammation in the body, potentially benefiting conditions like arthritis and other inflammatory diseases.
>
> 7. **Therapeutic Benefits**: Deep ketosis has been studied for its potential therapeutic effects on neurological conditions such as epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and even certain cancers. The high ketone levels provide an alternative energy source for brain cells and may have neuroprotective effects.
>
> 8. **Increased Physical Endurance**: For athletes, deep ketosis can enhance endurance by providing a consistent and long-lasting energy source, especially useful in endurance sports.

*(Ahh, Heart's Alone (1987).  I'd have thought that was a solid song out of '82 or '85.  Now, Springsteen's Brilliant Disguise makes sense.)*

And again, I am taking the following supplements:

* Caffeine
* NoSalt (potassium chloride)
* Iodine
* Green Tea Extract
* Cayenne
* Turmeric Curcumin
* Ginkgo Biloba

It synergizes well with this ketosis magic, further enhancing my mental prowess, stoking my fat-burning furnace, and empowering me to wield this radiant hammer of anti-inflammation and antioxidation.
