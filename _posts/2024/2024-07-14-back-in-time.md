Three hundred? Two hundred? Nope!

I'm back!

After dragging my feet across the plateau in The 39 Expedition, I decided to weigh myself this morning, a week into The 40th.  The result?  A loss of THREE lbs.  OK, I promise I won't take another sneak peek of the scale.  I was just checkin' to see if I had to do another four rounds with old Jose Sardino!

How good was that last kerklunk though?!

I *hope* I'm out of this slump and get back to these double-digit weight losses.  And if I'm mirroring the past in these days, I can fully expect a hefty weight drop. 

So, I'm *Back in Time*: the 100s! Now, thereâ€™s only 19 pounds left to beat my 2021 record. My ultimate goal, just 37 miles away, is to challenge 1995.

And you KNOW I got this.
