Sadly and expectantly, a couple of streaks were snapped yesterday: 64 oz of water a day and more importantly, my step goal streak.  Don't worry—the ones that matter remain: the Carnivore and *The Quest to Erebor* beard, The Yeard.  The water one is rather immaterial—I drink broth and coffee all the time. But, the step one hurt: I could not complete Day 27.  Well, I suppose I *could* have—I was only a 1000 steps away.

See, yesterday afternoon, I thought I'd pick up my Shoulders Day, because that morning, I had continued my plan to skip lifts to heal up my right forearm that got dinged on Tuesday's Chest Day.  

But, a few earfuls of tunes and a mug of [Phil Robertson coffee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-18s2WCXVto) got me amped up that afternoon!  I put the weight bench down in the middle of the kitchen (the garage is reserved)...  

...then setting my coffee aside, I darted off in a direction—my foot got caught from coming forward!  I just KNEW I was gonna fall on my face!  And yet, flouring and contorting about in my bullet time scene, I recovered!

However, relief quickly shifted downward to chagrin... 

This whole sequence of Neo pivoting on his little toe-just-behind-the nailbed bludgeoned an impact followed by a skin rupture.  And the blood welled up.  Boy howdy!  It bled like a shaving cut.  

Now, I would have already hit my 10,944 steps for the day if my morning routine hadn't iced over—truly, I miss that space!  And thus, I cast down the first 2024 record to smash for this year, a streak that began on Saturday, December 23, and ended yesterday.  

There are no plans to start today; after removing the bandages, my wife described it as "meaty."  

While I haven't had today's Arms Day, I won't lie, I'm longing for that, too!  This week, I felt those forearm pain twinges when just lifting a jug of water.  I know what I did wrong: when a dumbbell is on the floor and I'm on the bench, I'll reach behind me and grab it—not something I train!  

Maybe I ought to?  Let's see, Arnold has his press...how about the *Moose* Manacle? 

I need a complete nickname program.  Just think of the potential:

* *Shaquille O'Bill* Traverses: - [Toi Gye mountain blocks](https://youtu.be/lUNZ8kfNTsA?si=WyPeTWzCZUfkRs8n&t=15) with weights?

* *Brick* Static Holds?  - Not much imagination here.

* *Wild Bill* Matrix Re-enactments?*  - See above!

* *The Supersacker*  - That just sounds *painful.*

* *Norm* Hydration?  - my 10th-grade lunchtime's Powerade speed totally fits!

* \<insert [*Home Improvement*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQwYNca4iog) grunts\> *Rest Between Sets?* - Yes, this was a "nickname" I picked up in Taekwondo.  I'm always up for a good chest pounding.  Neanderthal blood flows through these veins!
