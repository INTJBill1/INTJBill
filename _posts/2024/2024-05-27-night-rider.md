And thus begins the 2nd day of The 39th Expedition.  When I started this whole thing back in the spring of '18, I was 39.  I wanted my 40s to be different.  I just...*refused* to keep doing what I did through my 30s.    

Yes, yesterday, I was miffed that I didn't drop below 200 lbs.  I forgot that I am 127 lbs down the road from New Year's Eve 2018—add another 5 to it for the heaviest weight of my life.

That's significant.

Come to think of it, I suppose my goal is to have lost more weight than what I once weighed, like weigh 160 after losing 171 (two weight classes in my high school wrestling; I was the latter).  I used to dream about that sort of thing.  At 326 lbs, double my high school 163, my thoughts would drift away as I tenderly sculpted my Blue Bell Cookies 'n Cream.  I envisioned as how I weigh exactly two of me, maybe I could split into two!  That *other* guy could do the yardwork.  

Somewhere along the way, a fire was lit.  I wanted *more*. 

And yeah, it has been the rollercoaster ride—you know the one. "Up and down the scale we go, where it'll stop nobody knows!"  I unashamedly share that with my tables and charts.  It is easier to not share that, to hide away with baggy clothes.  "Look away!  No, these orange-encrusted fingers are not clinching a makeshift panini of Doritos!"  But, we know we're not fooling anybody, least of all, that ol' mirror.  

So we make great strides; we beam with pride; buy new clothes! And...fall flat on our face.  The weight stack clinks together ever higher.  That happens to us, doesn't it?  We're disappointed in ourselves and turn to the thing that put us there in the first place!

BUT, we pick ourselves up off the ground, shake the dust off, and [*Do It Again*](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=ftCC7INv4Eo).  Some time ago, I declared that I would NEVER be 300 again.  And while there were close calls, I left April 2018 behind.

I want to do that again.  Not for 300—that's laughable.  For 200.  Yes, THAT 200 that I *ever-yearned* to achieve yesterday.  

See, on paper, I have NO business weighing in the 200s.  But, life just *feels* like I ought to be there, the SAME sort of feeling I once felt about 300.  The time I've lived in the 100s just seems like a dream.

I gotta change that!  I want to see 200 as I now do 300: laughable.  

[And I've got the roadmap.](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=J7p4bzqLvCw)  Since October 29, I have lost 70 lbs.  What's another 40?
