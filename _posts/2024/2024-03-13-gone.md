I either closed or abandoned accounts from a litany of vendors:

|Vendor| Dismissal Thoughts|
|--|--|
|**GiftExpress**| Is scent design in my future?|
|**Apple** | Oh the hegemony! My iPad will complain, but as far I'm concerned, it's 1997 all over again for Apple.|
|**Cricut**| Are printed T's really my style?|
|**eBay**| Is there life beyond belt buckles?|
|**Garmin**| Goodbye my morning sidekick...|
|**Smappen**| Great tool for radial mapping for planning walks, but...|
|**Starbucks**| My 2024 target for walking lost focus after dealing with self-entitled baristas.  "Look, you're wearing a nametag."|
|**ChatGPT**| I'm just disinterested in life projected by millennial robots who shoved the white-listed corpora into AI.|
|**Grammarly**| AI that takes on authority while overreaching and/or just being wrong.  Tada, your dystopian future, World.|
|**Idagio**| Eh, it always come off as incomplete when I want my themes to *Terminator*, *Knight Rider*, and *Miami Vice*.|
|**Kohl's**| Do I need *Yet Another Cheaply-manufactured Sweater*?|
|**Sketchup**| Sometimes the best plan is drawn onto a napkin...|
|**Chester County Library**| I *SUPPOSE* it's time to let go of this one.  But, I'll *never forget* 2020 with you!|
|**GitHub**| A great home for backup web hosting, but owned by Microsoft.  I copy Biblical truths and values, so I'd probably get banned. ðŸ¤ª |
| **Sony Playstation**| "Walk the roads my forefathers walked"|

## Google

Clearly, my final departure of Google is in the works.  It's not gonna be the blitzkrieg of my other services for Google's tentacles scratch and claw in so many areas!  But, I am acclimating in a different direction.  I've already moved to paid email for the going rate of the euro at â‚¬3/month for the year.  I've got Brave Browser in the starter role.  

Ultimately, I cast aside Google's progressive (and damning) ideology; this frog ain't in that boiling pot!

I've thought about going with NordVPN for a cloud hosting backup solution, but I suppose I've been eroded by its marketing campaign:  they pop up into all of my YouTube favorites!  Ryan George, City Planner Plays, Viva La Dirt League, Scammer Payback, Kitboga, and...I dunno maybe even squeezed between boxes of Little Debbie's over at Matt Mitchell's place!

...which brings up the most challenging part: dropping off YouTube when my family uses it as its central entertainment.  See, I just dropped $150 for YouTube Premium for the year!  But look, that's a sunk costâ€”DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT!  As to the other, I'm honored to take up the servant leadership role for my family; I'll make the play.  We've already re-emphasized tabletop together by dropping a heavy chunk for the 5-6 player expansion packs for Catan and Catan: Cites & Knights.  And I'm whirling together a spell as the DM in picking up our DnD sessions again. 

And while I thought about plopping 7 years of future domain ownership for INTJBill.com to match the 7 years I've had thus far, I just renewed for another year because...

> ...**We'll give it a shot**  
Whoa, we're half way there  
Whoa oh, livin' on a prayer  
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear  
Whoa oh, livin' on a prayer

It's important for me to capture my words down onto paper.  I'll never be here again.

## Bartlett Walking

I am also wrapping my *painting* of Bartlett with my morning walks.  It was something I did from December to February with its own memories contained, but I have since walked into a different space.
