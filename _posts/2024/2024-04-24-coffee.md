Is today a good day for me?

I have added another log onto the New Year's Resolutions fire: no coffee. It stems back to yesterday's dialogue. I had to face myself and ask why. Coffee is not in the mix for nutrition. There is a rich history and emotional attachments to the stuff from the outset, but as a fuel? Nah. Even its front-end benefits no longer apply: I take it now just to bring me back to default and to avoid what's gonna happen the next 4+ days, withdrawal symptoms. For now, at least an element of that has been cast aside as my two butter drinks (1 stick each) this morning have cast aside the headaches (for now).

Never will I forget: I am *alive!* Coffee cannot make me that way. 

First there was ATARI, then Nintendo, Sega Genesis, Sega Dreamcast, PlayStation 1, PlayStation 2, XBOX, Wii, XBOX 360, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation 4. All unique eras across the timeline of my life, always chasing that next hit of digital dopamine. I never made the leap to the next iteration. I won't. Yep, I am officially retiring from console gaming. My favorite over the years? Gotta be the Nintendo Entertainment System. Plenty of nostalgia. Those were special years.  People and places of a bygone era.
