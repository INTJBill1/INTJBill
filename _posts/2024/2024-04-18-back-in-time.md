Another Fat Focus day has passed and Thursday greets me with...
  
...a plate of salmon (4.3 oz),  
  
...a couple of hamburger patties (2 oz. each),   
  
...a side of prosciutto (1.1 oz),   
  
...and a dessert of iced butter coffee (1 stick of butter, 16 oz of coffee, and a 32 oz tumbler of ice). 

I'll have another tumbler later in the morning.

The Instant Vortex 6-qt air fryer is back in the starting lineup again—so easy, so clean!  I cooked at the following:

**Salmon**: 400℉ @ 7-8 min   
**Hamburger**: 400℉ @ 12 min  
**Proscuitto**: 400℉ @ just pop it in to get warm.  

Heated proscuitto has *got* to be one of the *best* foods in the world!  I'll feel the salt course through my veins.

And yes, ladies and gentlemen, that's what I eat where I'll pull off a double-digit weightloss for The 38th Expedition in 38 days.  Want to know more? I did a quick writeup of my [current strategy onto my Fit page](/fit/#current-strategy-what-ive-learned-after-over-six-years).

I changed the page's name since Phi comes off as more esoteric than I intend.  Plus, the Golden Ratio just reminds of years bygone at the Golden Corral—though, I was *totally* a Ryan's buffet boy.  You would have found me there as a kid to high school graduation after *every* morning church service for YEARS and YEARS!  Its recurring character of bread pudding was my favorite.

Also while re-working the Fit page, I rustled through the papers of my old posts to see my **Declaration** at age 39 was made tomorrow, some six years ago:

>...To move freely and interact in the world;  
>  
>...To glide upon the earth and spring to the heavens above;  
>  
>...To stretch out my arms like Wolverine and rail against the tempest of Death.

And considering [what I looked like in 2018](/fit/#background), I'd call that post visionary!

I have yet to hit that same look in 2021 with my beard or my size, but I'm on my 4th month of unfettered beard growth and I'm projecting that 182 lb weight in late-July / early-August.
