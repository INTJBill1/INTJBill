It is a TimeCop1983 [*Cruise*](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q99f2DSKcw&si=jkHkHHQianPHbwmG) kind of night. 

I *love* the legibility of this worn journal.  The main course is a system font stack with a healthy serving of font size, just a hint of spacing between letters, and a sprinkling of spacing between each word, all plated on a light canvas with black text.  Don't forget that generous portion of line spacing! 

Still, I want *more*.  My heart wants *more*.  It is 1992's *Constant Craving*; I want the night; I want shades of text on shadows, a synthwave symphony!  But, pupil dilation hammers cacophony on the sweet song of text.  The portal opens to that which entices us and the dark.  The shimmering lights of strings weave discord in the synapses. 

And thus, I return to this B/W theme.  Some things are just better that way.  Would I want *It's a Wonderful Life* in color?  When *The Andy Griffith Show* became Oz, the magic was lost.

They give us those nice bright colors  
They give us the greens of summers  
Makes you think all the world's a sunny day

This Player One considers the retrowave sunset against the purple nightsky:

> One ring to rule them all,  
One ring to find them,   
One ring to bring them all   
And in the darkness bind them.
