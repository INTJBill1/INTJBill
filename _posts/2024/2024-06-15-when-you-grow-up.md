I didn't think it was gonna happen.  I thought the Yeard was gonna come true.  But no, after 166 days, yesterday, I shaved.  Immediate thoughts: 

1. That epic *Dwarves of Erebor Under the Lonely Mountain* look won't happen this Christmas season.

2. The Beard covered up a TON of progress.

*What happened?*

Yesterday's post came to mind.  Specifically, that post about driving up in the old parking lot.  I was a daily shaver in those days; well, I ran sideburns down the length of my ears, but that was it.  That mountain of a man beard wasn't something I featured, though I *totally* could have pulled it off.  I *remember* I was nodding at the nuns with a cigarette in my hand at St. Joseph's on the day I was born.  

As I'm throttling down the road to my age 17 weight, I thought I'd set aside the beard. "Here, 2025, you can try it on."  I piled it all together and threw it in a Hefty bag.  It wasn't my oldest beard, that honor goes to an 8-monther, but the 'stache, yeah, that one was the BIGGEST of my life.  Made Sam Elliot's voice crack.  The thing completely covered my mouth, so much that I had to brush it to the side each day.

I don't know if I'll go back to my hair of those days: tapered on the sides and backâ€”leave the bangs.  The principal problem is that my bangs have left ME! 

Plus, I kinda like my hair long.  It's Flagstaff 2004; I can gather it together into a ponytail.  The mirror still sets me back:  he looks younger.  It's funny how a fat face makes us look old and lethargic.

Well, my face, legs, and arms are thin: can we *now* get to this core? I've got 35+ pounds to hack off this frame!  ["Get all of this junk out."](https://youtu.be/QpsZ6etEAVU?si=Fjqory1l9ZX3Os9a&t=41)  We'll drop in the new engine this autumn.

Within the cascading streams of Spotify, it's time for me to rumble off into the sunset to the Cornelius Brothers' [*Treat Her Like a Lady.*](https://open.spotify.com/track/75t6tcHkZDFKLKJwjXFMtq?si=0b65929cf132463c) (1970).
