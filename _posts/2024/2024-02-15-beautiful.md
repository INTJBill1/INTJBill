On paper, this morning may not have seemed like a red-letter day.  Even after my first set of Arnold presses, I paused for a beat.  Then when I emerged into the night, my left foot's blade/heel had a sharp pain that would crescendo from time to time within the greater context of being...just zapped.  I had NOTHING.  

I *knew* it was gonna be this kind of day.  After I broke my Fat Focus with a hunk of roast from the fridge to kick the day off, I tasted nothing, just the texture of the meat *(and my disdain for cold fat)*.  I grabbed my "cinnamon bun" butter coffee prepped yesterday...and there was NO cinnamon.

There's still nutritional value in taking my fat and protein, but it sure takes a lot of the fun away from my HFC diet.  I may just skip eating altogether today, something I can do on this since there's no demanding carb fixation.

So it was in all of this context that I had a good morning on my 4.6-mile walk behind the post office and the old library.  I could smile *(and I did)*.  Yes, my foot ached; yes, I felt like I weighed another 50-60 lbs and couldn't see how I had the ability to tear down the very same path the day prior.  But, I smiled because I was *doing it*.  I was digging deep and doing it.  I was leveling up my mental fortitude.  It was uncomfortable, but it was *beautiful*.
