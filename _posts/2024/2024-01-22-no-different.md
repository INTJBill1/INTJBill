I'm back in rhythm: yesterday, I restarted the step streak; today, as the temperatures have returned to the upper 20s, I got the chance to return to the streets in that 4 o'clock hour.  While I wanted my 5-mile route, the ice hazards rerouted me to cut it in half.  I spent too much time concentrating on my footpath!  That said, I got to apply my newly acquired narrow walking ability from that 19" walking pad.

A little ice and snow can't stop me!  It's even less than the stuff I walked daily over the John O'Connell Bridge in my commute in Sitka.  *(Contextually, I left for Alaska not even owning a coat.  Picked that up en route with a stop at the Ketchikan Walmart.)*

That said, I miss my pullover ice cleats.  Once a staple, who needs that in Tennessee?  I mean, I only slipped once today (crossing Memphis Arlington Rd).

I had a good morning of lifting.  It has been a different year:  I don't put much value from one Expedition to another (there have been so many), rather, I eagerly await the results of New Year's Eve.  It's something I think about before my sets.  I cannot say I think about it during each repâ€”I run around the house during each rest, piling clothes in the washer and deftly putting away dishes at that 3 AM hour.  I do have time on my hands after all...technically?

As I look toward December 2024, my thoughts fall on that St. Jude's race.  It has long been on my mind, whether watching my coworker run pass in 2003 as I fast inside Molly's La Casita...[dreaming of *that day*](/2018-04-19-the-hybrid-specialization/) in the 2010's...or shaking my head at its zombie outbreak policy in 2021 thereby inspiring me to create [the Wolverine Cup Series](/2021-10-25-2021-september-87-meet-me-at-the-danc/).

What lies ahead for 46?
