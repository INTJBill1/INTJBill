As I pen this diary entry, my site only exists in a text editor.  I mean, if you gussy VS Code up, you could call this thing a "code editor" that lingers around the Integrated Development Environment store on weekends.

But, it feels like I have just a box of text docs...YEARS and YEARS of text docs! We could go back to 1989 on my XT clone running DOS 4 and we could read these words.  We would have to store all uncompressed 2.8 MB of this site on both sides of EIGHT 5.25" floppy diskettes.  I'm assuming my 11-year-old self had access to the typical 360 KB ones instead of the 1.2 MB.

And whala, I just moved my domain registration from NearlyFreeSpeech (NFS) to the *massively* superior Cloudflare.  The thing is a BEAST!  I would have left everything alone, but NFS has made a departure from being apoliticalâ€”hey, I prefer their old snarky IT voice, as if my web host was [*Nick Burns, Your Company's Computer Guy*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25J3u3P-HHg).  They have been that way for a good *long* time, at least since I signed up with them some 7 years ago. 

Transferring my domain to Cloudflare didn't cost me anything beyond renewing my domain for an additional year; it's now expiring in April 2026.  They even provide free privacy of your contact info from DNS lookups, something I used to plop $3 down each year.

Domain registration is one thing.  What about the core purpose, NFS's role as my web host?  

This is where moving to Jekyll/markdown years ago plays a significant role!  [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) provides a FREE option.  As listed [here](https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/developer-platform/) under the Pages side heading:

* 1 build at a time
* 500 builds per month
* Integrated web analytics
* Unlimited free admin seats
* Unlimited sites
* Unlimited requests
* Unlimited bandwidth 

Going live wasn't too challenging: I have to use a third-party Git site to host my markdown.  In figuring out its deployment, I had to run down two issues: one, it didn't autodetect my usage of Jekyll so I had to specify; and two, it failed on my gem file of...

```gem "jekyll", "~> 4.2.1"```

...whereas it rendered when I updated it with...

```gem "jekyll", "~> 4.3.0"```

ChatGPT proved to be invaluable as a companion in all this.  Especially with awkward NFS documentation that is an astounding 427 muddied words in length!  All of it could be remedied with a screenshot and MAYBE 5 bullet points.  If the writer wants to meander, he ought to make a blog on Cloudflare.

To put it into perspective, this post is 440 words at this point.
