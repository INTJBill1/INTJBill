Last night, a shirtless Santa in shades and a pair of sandals swung by my place as he played Kenny Chesney in that ol' sleigh of his.  His elves are still hammering away up north, but I appreciate Santa stopping over for some chitchat..."Oh Santa, you KNOW I don't drink that cocoa!"  Appropriately enough, we still have eggnog and gingerbread flavored coffee from last season. 

>Oh, the weather outside is scorching  
And the sun is so unrelenting  
And since we've no place to go  
Let it glow, let it glow, let it glow  
>
> The heat isn't showing signs of easing  
So I've got some ice for drinking  
The fans are turned on high, you know  
Let it glow, let it glow, let it glow

I gifted 5 sets of Dungeons & Dragons dice each to everyone in the house.  My son is taking over DMing duties as I shift to the role of a player for the first time.  My first class ever?  [A monk](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/11-monk).  It seemed befitting.

Yes, we are halfway through the year and are near upon Mid Year's Eve.

On to other things: this site has been updated.

Changelog:

* Retired *The Expeditions.* (!)
* Took down the *Fit* page with its diet streak counter and graphs/tables of my historical weighin. (!)
* Removed *New Year Resolutions.*
* Added *Fitness Goals* to celebrate Mid Year's Eve.
* A style shift.

You know, I just feel as though I am beyond what I once did.  It was an extended campaign of sliding down the scale and vaulting high above until I put the brakes on and rode the ride swiftly down again. 

I laid it out before the world to show it can be done: learn from my mistakes; these are the steps that can be undertaken to WIN.  

I wish it was the sort of thing that could have been handed to me when I started back in 2018.

But, I am moving on.  I find interest in capability and capacity.  I am still losing weight, but now I see it as a function of increasing both of those.  

I am moving toward homeostasis.  The weight I should be will be my weight.  As I have written before, it is just a matter of time.  But at the end of the day, what will I have achieved when I get there?  What can I do?  My diet doesn't make me *better*, it just resets me back to what I should have been.
