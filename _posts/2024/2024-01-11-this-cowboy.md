I'm doing a *fat focus* day.  I suppose other folks would call it a fat fast, but it's not like I'm abstaining from protein; it's just not my focus.  Look, there's protein in my butter and coffee that I drink; never could I say I'm *not* having it.  I'm just not eating eggs, bacon, etc to hit my protein targets.

I have ignited this morning with steamy chicken broth!  It's been something like 52 oz.  It just *feels* right.

I'm refueling after another solid performance in my 2:30 AM mornings.  It was my Shoulders dayâ€”I love Shoulders days.  Then again, I love Chest days...and Arms...and Back...and I'm beginning to fall in love with Abs day.  The key is to jack up your dopamine levels and engage in the behavior.  And thus why coffee is in my diet!  

But, it is a GOOD routine: Arnold press, seated rear lateral raise, and upright rows.  It's not much, but with my high rep/lightweight approach, most days are a totality of 225 reps.  Still, I see a path where more will be added in the future.  

Three exercises feel good to remain empowered as I did today to then hit cardio outside for 1:21:08.  I headed out there in the night with my green light "(raging) against the dying of the light". Railing against the darkness, [my "fitness shove" song](https://open.spotify.com/track/1DgtQlVNotingln271ZKCx?si=bc6d1de201144ce3) was at the top.

Speaking of which, this morning I hit LEVEL 4 on Garmin with 140 points by picking up the 2024 January Gains badge for weightlifting.

It is an [Alaska belt buckle](https://www.ebay.com/itm/256332815677) kind of day.  I've got the 38-year-old, colored one on right now, straight out of 1986.  Yeah, that's the Alaska I remember:

* Commuted on foot regularly with twelve bald eagles overhead;
* Lived next to the island with the highest density of brown bears in the world;
* Watched a moose eat my neighbor's tree; Had moose legs pass me in while sitting in traffic in my GMC Yukon;
* Hiked by hundreds (if not thousands) of dead salmon on the banks of a stream in a rainforest.
