## Homeschool

I haven't written for a bit about my homeschool approach.  For the past couple of days, I've been investing a few bucks into their education:

**[BJU Press Fundamentals of Literature Grade 9](https://www.christianbook.com/fundamentals-literature-student-2nd-edition/9781628564365/pd/514042?event=Homeschool\|1004344)**   
I bought a single, student textbook as opposed to the teacher edition and a couple of copies.  I want to expose my kids the value of self-study, perhaps not pure autodidacticism as I'll be setting the pace and asking for feedback for the system of study.

**[*New Answers Book* Box Set Volumes 1-4](https://www.christianbook.com/new-answers-book-box-volumes-1/ken-ham/9780890518199/pd/518199)**   
While this wouldn't be a full-blown science class, I thought pulling a Q/A each day and discuss together would be beneficial.

**Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion**   
Fantasy co-op strategy, teamwork, and number-crunching!  And according to [this Meeple Mountain review](https://www.meeplemountain.com/reviews/gloomhaven-jaws-of-the-lion/), this Mini-Me scaffolds onboarding which, if the game is compelling, I just may buy the big ol' hoss of tabletop game, the 35-lb Frosthaven.

**Hegemony: Lead Your Class to Victory**   
While I've watched a few YouTube reviews of this tabletop game, it was only after reading [Meeple Mountain's review](https://www.meeplemountain.com/reviews/hegemony-lead-your-class-to-victory/) did I pull the trigger.  Thus far, at $90, it's my most expensive single title board game.

**Poker chips and a couple decks of cards**  
THIS critical life lesson: life [only *looks* like a gamble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZQln6DsWgE)...

### Ordered but Now on Hold:

***Shakespeareâ€™s Tragedies: Macbeth, Othello, King Lear and Hamlet*: Slip-case Edition**   
I already have one kid that enjoys reading The Bard.

**[Target Math Game](https://www.elevateprep.com/target-math-game)**  
Mental math is fun!  Conceptually, I ran across the idea [from watching a DnD session](https://youtu.be/5EmKMdGzMWk?si=CIdS6MqqCLcV1BbC&t=750) of a puzzle involving an elevator in a great bean stalk leading up to a land of giants.

## 2024

There is change in the air, things running on a timetable much sooner than I had anticipated.  I welcome this new landscape as if there was one focus I've proved o'er, it's that while gearing up for 1978, God shoved a battered toolbox with these words etched into the metal: "*INNATE ABILITY TO ADAPT.*"

And quite honestly, I knew where my heart was in 2021-23, and so I should have reflected further on things!  Ahh, hyper-adaptability can be a peril!  But see, I just have this profound sense that whatever happens in life, I can make things work.  I mean, I am the quintessential duct tape guy!  Play my theme!
