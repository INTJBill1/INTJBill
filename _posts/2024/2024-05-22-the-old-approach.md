That new *old* theme did not last for long, did it?  Its release coincided with my 2½ hour yardwork session, an event that strips me of my eyesight prowess.  Sure, I wear safety eyewear, but nevertheless, grass slaps me silly.  My astigmatism changes and now, everything two feet in front of me is a hazy, illegible dream.  

I'll edge and then mow it, but it makes me wonder what societal convention am I following here?  Isn't it *strange* how we have all agreed to do this, all of these tiny squares of grass, meticulously maintained.  Yes, I shape and form these weeds to stand in formation!  "Bow before me! I am your king, the venerable Grasslord!"  

My spirit remains headed toward the retrowave sun, but my site design?  Driving toward clean and optimized, the same way I want to live with all these...*materials*...around me.  As I traverse life, the less things I want.

Lately, I've been catching the Michael Landon series from 1974, *Little House on the Prarie*.  It is a romantic notion, isn't it?  No telecommunications—no electricity even!  Just hard work with your own two hands.  

Admittedly, I am drawn to that world.  Of course, my father's world before Uncle Sam and 1953 was one of a single light bulb and an outhouse.  Undeniably, it has been in our blood for a long time.

Now, how did I have all of this tech abomination in my life—how bizarre!  Yes, your president of a high school's computer club and *Who's Who of Computer Science*.  What nonsense.  Yes, in this Instagram world, it does not seem so extreme.  But, in that early-to-mid 90s era?  Life was basically Pong in comparison and far more enriching!  This, I remember.  

After 7 years, as old as this domain name, my Google account is G-O-N-E.  Like [*Already Gone*](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=yJD8ABf5jbY&si=9ghcvPyQ7TctAv-i)!  Yesterday, I attempted to recover it because I thought spreadsheet sharing might come in handy.  As I tried, my response was...*relief*.  I believe my first reference of leaving came way back on June 16, 2018's [*GOOG Cutting.*](/2018-06-16-goog-cutting/)  It was a long time coming.  And 2024 was the year I did it, the same year I weighed in at 163 and....

We had a love so hard to find  
Oh so full of life, so free and easy  
Another place, another time

> Close your eyes, and take a look at your life  
Do you like what you see?  
My eyes are open, but I feel like I'm blind  
It's all returning to me  
I want to know, does a frozen river flow?  
Things you said fill my head

So I looked at the scenery, she read her magazine  
And the moon rose over an open field...
