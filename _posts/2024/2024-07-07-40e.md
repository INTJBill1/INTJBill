## Results

I hit the shelf. 

The results for The 39th Expedition are in: **-0.98%** or -2 lbs.

And this is the part where I plug into how my daily macro averages were on point and matched the past.  Eh, it's on the [Fit](/fit/#ships-stores) page. Check it out.

...and once again proving that calories mean nothing as my daily calorie intake was **2272**.  Expeditions 28-32 and 34-38 were:

2253, 2111, 2152, 2306, 2304 \| 2099, 2363, 2262, 2236, 2357

I even maintained my typical 87% calories from fat schema!

What ought I conclude?  I got an Expedition (36) that is 10 calories less per day than the last one but gave 5.5 times the results?  So you're telling me that 420 kcal total difference is the equivalent of 38,500 kcal?  And what do we do with six-week periods where I ate MORE and lost MORE?  C'mon, man!  Yeah, let's put a nail in the coffin of that whole *calories-in / calories-out* nonsense.  ["Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Think Mcfly, Think."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhJGOYJo9mM)

Clearly, calories are serving as some sort of proxy for macros or a descriptor of *something* going on with the macros.  But in this case, EVERYTHING was up to spec.  I *should* have done what I've done.  And maybe I have...

Interestingly enough, there are parallels to the past: check [the comparison](/fit/#maps) with this stage and my keto-turned-carnivore approach that did NOT track macros.  From the same days of 210 to 252 at roughly the same place (223 vs. 204), I lost 2.75 lbs back in Jan-Feb 2021, nearly matching the 2 lbs this time around.  Perhaps its purely coincidental, but I've got no explanation as to why I have nothing to show for my efforts.  It's not unlike that Expedition where I worked out every day and ate right only to wind up right where I began.

*(shhh...it's about the hormones)*

I have high confidence that next weigh-in, I just may skip the 190s entirely.  After that last two weigh-ins, it's time for a [*Breakout*](https://open.spotify.com/track/0nv34PfYOvpRFAppCnF9KP) from *Of Yachts & Speedboats* of June-July 2020.

> Breakout (breakout)  
Take these chains from me  
You held my heart for ransom   
Baby, set it free  

Nevertheless, I will make adjustments: 

* Return to Fat Focus days.
* Bring Back Small Victory Win Conditions.
* Maintain a Spotify Subscription.
* Join Facebook on New Year's Eve.
* Restore This Site to Retrowave.

Not quite the fitness shift you might have expected?

## Carnivore

I appreciate Kelly Hogan's take on the mental/motivation approach in her YouTube post from yesterday: [*Carnivore Story time: Shark's Teeth & 1954*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DAcOO8wX9g).  For now, we share the same age before my soon leap to 46.  And she looks *GREAT*!  

I lean a little toward envy of people who have a cohort to band together and as a team accomplish success together.  I wholly agree with Kelly on that—the value of folks who don't drag on ya, but encourage efforts.  I cannot imagine what it would be like to have five carnivore friends where we're all encouraging and pursuing fitness together.  

There are times I get down, like today's weigh-in.  I *should have* broken through the 200-lb barrier 12 weeks ago.  Nevertheless, here I am.  I did what I set out to do and I've got nothing to show for it.  I suspect if I didn't open up on my blog about all of this, I would silently just snag 5-6 cartons of Blue Bell and run my own [*Bless Your Rank*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaYIgbQkHln5g6L5ybqrWi5gg2hkqHaUO).

While I have been on carnivore for over 8 months now, of late, I've been traveling on the great plateau in stall country.  I *suppose* I could ascribe it to this *gone haywire* body of mine.  I find this condition as a feature of my life, a blessed one, a reminder of my mortality, and a traveler that asks how important certain roads are in getting to where I'm going.

## Time

These days, I've been gazing over my life far more than I ever have.  My mind reflects on the important crossroads and the people who have traveled along with me along the way until their exit ramp came up.   

There's value in providing a practical analog to the abstract of time.

With respect to viewing my life as a college football game, I've got about 4 minutes left in the 3rd quarter.

* **The End of the 1st quarter:**:  Christmas 1993, high school sophomore
* **The Start of the 3rd Quarter**:  Graduate school kickoff, August 2011, age 33
* **The Start of the 4th Quarter**: March 2028, age 50

The metaphor came to me as I listened to marching band covers–it has been a fun diversion, somehow related to my affinity for acapella.
 
## Dungeons & Dragons

More related to me than what you may think on the surface, I had a lot of ideas in forming the backstory of Elf monk in DnD.  It is sort of a...

* **Kwai Chang Caine** from *Kung Fu* meets...
* **Morgan** from *The Walking Dead* meets...
* ***The A-Team*** meets...
* **Geralt** from *The Witcher*.

And while all the write-up's ideas are my own with the exception of the Giant village and the Dwarf beast, ChatGPT rendered my details into a complete backstory.

**Background of Geralt, the Elf Monk:**

**Name:** Geralt

**Aliases:**
- **Taur-rim (Elves):** "Wild Stalker"
- **Urg'glok (Giants):** "Shadowstrike"
- **Ungaz-Zammune (Dwarves):** "Wild Friend"

**Early Life:**
Geralt was born into the wild and raised by a pack of wolves, learning the ways of survival, loyalty, and the laws of nature. This upbringing shaped his instincts and skills, making him one with the wilderness until an Elven raiding party slaughtered his wolf family and took him captive as a youth. The Elves lit the bodies of his wolf family afire, forcing Geralt to watch as his only family burned.

**Tragedy and Transformation:**
Taken by the Elves, Geralt's sorrow for his slain wolf family transformed into a fierce desire for vengeance. He was trained as a monk, but his heart remained wild. Discovering the Elven king's role in his pack's death, Geralt avenged them by killing the king. It was after this act that the Elves named him Taur-rim, "Wild Stalker," reflecting his untamed spirit and deadly precision.

**Wandering Protector:**
Geralt became a fugitive, wandering from village to village, protecting the oppressed and fighting against tyranny. His journey mirrored that of a lone hero, using his skills to aid those in need and dismantle corrupt regimes.

**Reputation and Names:**
- **Taur-rim (Wild Stalker):** Among the Elves, Geralt is known for his forest prowess and predatory nature, symbolizing his deep connection to the wild.
- **Urg'glok (Shadowstrike):** The Giants call him this for his stealthy and deadly combat style, a name he earned when he infiltrated a Giant's fortress to free captive villagers, striking with lethal precision from the shadows.
- **Ungaz-Zammune (Wild Friend):** The Dwarves gave him this name after he saved a Dwarven settlement from a marauding beast, earning their respect and friendship through his loyalty and bravery.

**Quarterstaff and Martial Arts:**
Geralt's quarterstaff, crafted from the heartwood of a tree growing where his wolf family was burned, symbolizes his connection to them and his vow to protect the innocent. His martial arts training emphasizes control, precision, and inner peace, helping him channel the rage from his family's death into focused, purposeful action.

**Mentorship and the Name Geralt:**
After killing the Elven king, Geralt encountered an enigmatic wanderer who saw potential in him. This mentor trained Geralt further as a monk, focusing on the use of the quarterstaff to quiet his rage-filled mind. The wanderer named him "Geralt," inspired by the Germanic roots of the name, symbolizing "rule of the spear" and reflecting his mastery over his weapon and his role as a protector and avenger.

**Philosophy:**
Guided by his own moral compass, Geralt operates from a chaotic-good perspective. He shuns material wealth and power, finding fulfillment in aiding the helpless and fighting oppression. His actions are unpredictable but always aimed at justice and freedom for the oppressed.

**Rage and Control:**
Despite his training, Geralt always has rage just below the surface, a constant reminder of his tragic past. Through his monk training and mastery of the quarterstaff, he maintains control over this inner fury, using it as a source of strength rather than a hindrance.

**Intricate Plot Involvement:**
The names given to Geralt by different races reflect his journey and the alliances he has formed. The Elven name, Taur-rim, points to his origins and the initial tragedy. The Giant name, Urg'glok, highlights his stealth and combat prowess. The Dwarven name, Ungaz-Zammune, emphasizes his role as a protector and friend to those in need.

The death of the Elven king left a power vacuum, causing unrest among the Elves. Meanwhile, Geralt's reputation as a wandering hero has made him a symbol of hope for the oppressed and a target for those in power. His journey continues, driven by the ghosts of his past and the quest for justice in a world rife with corruption and cruelty.
