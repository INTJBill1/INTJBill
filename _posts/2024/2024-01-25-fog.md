It's another Fat Focus Day for me!  It was also a Shoulders Day, one in which I was especially sensitive to my forearm ding because I felt it throughout the upright row movement.  I can't put in the weight my shoulders need, but it's important to me to put in *something* and not push to hit a normal day and then go dark.

For the very same reason, today was a 3.5 mile route when I had planned to return to the 5.1 mile path.

But, it's not out of motivation!  As soon as I hit the door for cardio, I was delighted!  It was like I was in a video game as god rays abounded through the fog.  It created a *fun* morning walk!  The ambiance was surreal as fog shrouded the streets.

I'm mapping out routes for specific days.  I'll have better consistency if a plan is in place.  I also want to start integrating intervals on certain days.

I've also been drinking a LOT of fluids today.  By the last dregs of the 6 AM hour, I drank a half-gallon of water, a quarter-gallon of chicken broth, and 2 cups of coffee.  Makes it a little tight on today's Zombie Outbreak belt buckle!
