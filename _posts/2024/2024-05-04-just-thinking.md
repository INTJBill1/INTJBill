I want a simple life, the kind of life beyond the suburbs.  Some place not here, a spot where "I hear nothing, not even a sound on the streets...Just the beat of my own heart."

I long for the rhythm of leaves rustling.  I want to feel the grass between my toes and glide through a mountain's mist.

I want to be more than virtually disconnected from everything I know.  I don't want to grow old with tech. 

Do I *even* want muncipal electricity?  Water?

I want to learn to live with these two hands.  I want to shower in a thunderstorm.  I want to be *me*, not another fine product off the conveyor belt.

I don't belong in the city.

> The traffic roars  
The sirens scream  
You look at the faces  
It's just like a dream  
Nobody knows where you're going  
Nobody cares where you've been    
...  
When you said goodbye   
You were on the run  
Trying to get away  
From the things you've done  
Now you're back again  
And you're feeling strange  
So much has happened  
But nothing has changed  
You still don't know  
Where you're going
