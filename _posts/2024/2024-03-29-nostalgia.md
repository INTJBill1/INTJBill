Admittedly, I get more nostalgic than I should.  I don't know why...I just have a memory for things that once were.  As to the present, those things whip by and these 45-year-old eyes pay them no mind; the months and years plummet off the calendar.  

But, something 25-30 years ago?  

Sometimes it *feels* like yesterday.  I'll hear a song from '91 or '92 and feel what I once did, how the world was a big place, full of mystery and wonder that lay just outside my home's front door.  I had a heart to extend that was shrouded by an introvert's misgivings.  It was a time long before the world calloused such things.  Isn't that the path we take toward adulthood?  Sarcasm and distrust smash dreamlands and hammer out armors of intellect.

Bon Jovi's *She Don't Know Me* is a befitting anthem for the high school guy who inflects, implies, and infers affection.  Each day, I rummaged around my closet and pulled out one outfit: The Nice Guy.  I wore it well; it seemed to fit.

It didn't speak anything beyond a middling honors student.  It did not show my heart for adventure.  There were no highlights that lit up the room as to a passion for independent thought with a willingness to leave the known to pursue something greater.  No, I was thought of as "nice." And it's true, I was the guy parents wanted to meet and call on their daughter.

I had no interest in academics.  Now, I was in THE classes—I did them—but there was no challenge—no unique thought; it just didn't capture my attention.  Now social interplay...now THAT captivated me.  And I suspect my being its student forwarded my social ability as an INTJ, who are not renowned for our capacity to "show" empathy.  And I suspect the social side did challenge me, as the class I would have LOVED to study, physics, was taught by a coach and prominently featured free time of chess.  Or, is it more accurate to say it was a chess course that had a downtime of physics?

On a side note: to some extent, understanding how *The Others* lived was of particular interest, so much that I stepped down from honors and took standard English and U.S. History classes my junior year; a semester of study hall; and a class down in the vo-tech wing. 

I was curious.  It's not unlike my approach at university.  I seemingly didn't feel like the university general education requirements were enough;  I took more.  It was at a time when you plopped enough cash down to become a full-time student by taking 4 classes, you could take up to 3 more classes for FREE.  

College was going to an all-you-can-eat buffet!  I didn't take 1 PE course, I took 4.  I didn't *need* criminal justice or psychology—I WANTED them.  Sometimes I took classes to see what they were like before dropping them, which tied directly into Music Appreciation and another in classical guitar.  I suppose that behavior didn't fit the range between the do-the-bare-mininum, ever-sleepy college student and the exuberant, tongue-wagging, dean's lister on a leash.

Still, back in high school, I was developing confidence.  I didn't know I was an INTJ until I was 16 and I'm not so sure if I knew I was an introvert then.  Just different.  I always knew I had a blitz of ideas in my head that I kept bottled up.  I'd debate with my Sunday School teacher.  Things were harder for me in a world dominated by extroverts.  But you learn to play the game, to mimic, to toss yourself into the dark abyss of uncomfortable situations.  To this day, I dislike gatherings at people's homes—the feints and schemes of social strata.  But to get lost on some train platform with another as we hold a timetable in French or Polish?  Now THAT's living! 

I was never the type to have a girl around my arm walking down those high school hallways.  Not that I didn't *want* that—what guy wouldn't want that?  Interestingly, I saw girls at other schools; I *knew* the game: in my pocket, I had the mirror, comb, and mouth spray.  I studied the game for a long time.  But, I guess it was the fear of rejection that I did not want to lose what I did have.  I didn't roll the dice at the risk of losing daily friendships, the exact type of person that made sense, instead of the no-risk, two-dimensional ones I chose.  And when these lectures were over, it was too late while "knowing that the day my lessons finally learned."

But, I learned.  Perhaps that classwork rivals that semester of typing as the biggest lesson I learned in high school.  And a new landscape was unlocked in Fall 1996 as I stepped onto a college campus, already vested into its social intricacies in the first 10 minutes with someone I'd later roll a nat 1 on that semester.

## My "New" Phone

I know this is revolutionary, but I am going to use my cell phone like a cell phone!  It might as well be my Nokia in the 90s—it can't take a beating like that Nokia did!  And I don't have to buy a $50 battery that could add vibration.  

Instead of this Samsung *life buddy*, I'll use my phone for a quick phone call of where to meet or at age 21 or 22, for a confirmation of when your Mustang convertible's alternator locks up on the Bluegrass Parkway and belts go a-flyin'.  Incidentally, that is also a good time to keep a credit card on your person.
