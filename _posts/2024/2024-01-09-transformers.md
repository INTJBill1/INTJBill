By pressing on mile 5 of yesterday's cardio, I knocked my right foot out of whack, specifically on the outer midfoot.   While I added 6500 more steps for the day, I skipped the afternoon barefoot treadmill.  In the meantime, I drank more chicken broth for its gelatin.

This morning, my body chose an extended down period for repair.  I never detected my Garmin alarm at 2:30 AM or its subsequent reminder 10 minutes later.  

And thus, I woke up at 4:30 AM, squeezed out my chest day, and then waded through the streets.  I sloshed to the local park to put it in cruise control.  I would roll a couple of miles onto the odometer before picking up the 100 walking activities badge from Garmin and hitting the showers.  

This morning is not unlike the other day when my accursed Xero Prio's aggravated my left patella as I passed the first milemarker.  How I look forward to setting aside this backpack of Brick!

...and that's what 2024 is forâ€”it's really all about this:
