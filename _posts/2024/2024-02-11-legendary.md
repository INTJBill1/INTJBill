It's Sunday so it's another Fat Focus Day!  And here I am, past a stein of coffee replete with a stick of butter and set to charge with 6 cups of roast broth (thinking of #7 and #8)! I write as I prep for chicken broth for the days to come!

For the third day in a row, I have earned at least one Garmin badge, this time, my 4th ***Rise and Grind:*** *- Record an activity between 4 a.m. and 7 a.m. every day for 7 consecutive days*. 

I had a *fantastic* cardio morning.  While I thought yesterday's 8-mile walk would be the event of the weekend, today's 5.67-mile path was only held back because my Garmin was down to 3% power.  At 33.7 miles total, today pushed this week's mileage beyond the totals of the prior 4 weeks, with only the first week of the year's activities 35.92 to beat.  

I wanted to capture more real estate for 2024's showpiece.  I took a western edge of Bartlett, Montpelier/Yates, and turned the corner on Woodlawn to walk the length of Bartlett High School, a length so long that it goes beyond the posted school zone.  

Initially, the high school's architecture was a callback to my time walking on the University of Memphis campus.  I then began to absorb a radiation of warm feelings.  I recalled the video I watched on YouTube in [*"Until I Fall Away"*](2023-10-06-bartlett).  

I turned toward Stage and strolled past our first printing storefront, circa 1990.  I looked into its window and could see that year.  The nostalgia felt appropriate as I thought of my Dad on this 20th anniversary which led me to write [*Passage*](/2004-02-15-passage/).

I took the historical Sycamore View back up and passed the Blackwell House that nearly compelled me to sing, "Buffalo Gals Won't You Come Out Tonight" and pick up a rock to hurl in its direction.  But no, George Bailey walked on.
