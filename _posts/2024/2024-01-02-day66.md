@Nightcall: the thermometer hit 27℉ and I hit the streets.  I wore my Xero Prio 9's from 2023.  I had concerns going into the walk, as in flayed flesh the chafing fruit of yesterday's record.  Nevertheless, I strode ahead, modifying my gait a bit.  Well, just after my 10-minute mark, my left knee's warning light popped on.  Dang it.  The chafing and the knee—I can still make it!  But should I?

OF COURSE, right?  So I turned into the Oak Forest neighborhood and..U-turned.  I want this year to be *different*.  It's not about my gallant, all-or-nothing efforts.  Those things wind up disabling me for a quarter of the year.  I *do* want cardio every day.

And thus, I looped back.  In a sense, it was a shame because my first mile pace was nearly a minute less than yesterday's first mile.  But, it's like my throwing back 20 grams of protein worth of cold ground beef this morning after my chest day session: nothing is flippant.

Earlier, I had a plan to buy 12 belt buckles for 2024 (and only 12).  I'm nearly at my limit!

I dunno if I'm gonna keep it to 12!  *There is No Arizona!*  Give me *Memphis, Tennessee!*
