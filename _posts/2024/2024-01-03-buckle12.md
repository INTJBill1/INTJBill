While I may do away with the twelve buckle limit, I have chosen belt buckle #12 for 2024.  It was more than I typically spend.  It's twenty years old, appropriate for 2024:

The [2004 Arizona State Fair Showmanship for goats](https://www.ebay.com/itm/116008406639).

...it's from Arizona...

...back in 2004...

...has a goat on it...

...and for showmanshp, something for "about how hard a person has worked, prepared and presents their animal to the judge."

2004 was a big year for me:

* Mourned the passing of my Dad;
* Quit my career job in hardware support;
* Backpacked in Europe for the very first time and journeyed from the Highlands of Scotland to the cobblestones of Rome;
* Camped at the Cornerstone Music Fesitval in Illinois;
* Departed my childhood hometown and moved to Flagstaff, Arizona;
* Became vegan and lost 50 lbs;
* Stayed at a KOA in Savannah, Georgia and swam in the ocean for the first time;
* Moved back to Memphis and slept for ~3 months in the cold on a concrete floor until Christmas;
* Gave away my Chevy Silverado and purchased a $400 GT hybrid bicycle for commuting to my new job as a technical writer (I started that job today, 19 years ago: 1/3/05).

SEE? Thus far, 2004 is the *Greatest of All Time* year.  Ah, now that Arizona goat buckle is clicking!
