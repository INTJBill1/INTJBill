## The 2024 New Year's Resolutions

### The Measurable

1. 🥩 Push my high-fat carnivore diet streak to 430 days.
1. 👖 Drop from a 42" pair of Wrangler's to a 31" Levi's.
2. 🏆 Shift shoulders-to-waist from 0.932 to the golden ratio (φ), 1.618.
3. 💪 Increase arm size ½" to 17" while in the backdrop of significant weightloss.

### The Fable

1. 🎁 Develop my own fashion style as I scale down.  Buy at least 3 outfits for each six-week training period with a heavy emphasis on symbolic belt buckles. 
2. 🔥 Create and run in twelve 5Ks, complete with a relevant t-shirt and/or memento for each event! Kickoff @ <179 lbs.
3. 🌆 Grow the Yeard. Eve to Eve.
