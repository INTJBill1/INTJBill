The past presents the future;<br/>
The future portrays the past.<br/>
For the present is the stage,<br/>
Which past and future are made.<br/>
<br/>
Another year<br/>
Another life to live down here<br/>
Another chance<br/>
Another time of circumstance<br/>
<br/>
What shall I make it to be?<br/>
What road shall I choose for me?<br/>
Decisions made foolishly<br/>
Build lost possibility.<br/>
<br/>
Another year<br/>
Another span of fates appear<br/>
Another chance<br/>
Another attempt at romance<br/>
<br/>
Life of perpetuityâ€”<br/>
Nothing new continually!<br/>
Upon this trek, there must be<br/>
More than mere, bland constancy!<br/>
<br/>
Another year<br/>
Another quest for one who's dear<br/>
Another chance<br/>
Another spin within life's dance<br/>
