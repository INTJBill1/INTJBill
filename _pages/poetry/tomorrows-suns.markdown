<div class="poetry">

Floating moods of relevance,<br/>
Guides one in no direction.<br/>
Roads of swinging prominence,<br/>
Allows no absolution.<br/>
<br/>
What's chosen in the present,<br/>
Gives birth to future minions.<br/>
What's minute in the minute,<br/>
Grows large in tomorrows' suns.<br/>
