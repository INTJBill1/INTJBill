<div class="poetry">

Who am I now? Where should I be? <br/>
Where am I going? What will I see? <br/>
There's one thing I know, that I'm going to be. <br/>
Somewhere down the road, somewhere far from here. <br/>
If there's one thing I surely fear <br/>
It's languishing in my own prison here. <br/>
Trapped within my own conceived walls <br/>
Limited by what constitutes me. <br/>
<br/>
