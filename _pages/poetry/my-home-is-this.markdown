Within the haven of holy,<br/>
This hallowed 3AM hour,<br/>
My spirit is of a child's<br/>
Splashing one puddle to the next.<br/>
<br/>
The hands of the world are frozen:<br/>
All that is good, all that is bad,<br/>
All is locked to shackle decay<br/>
Of this moment of pristine time.<br/>
<br/>
Open I heave the heavy gate<br/>
Of societal consciousness.<br/>
I blithely bound beyond the door,<br/>
Past the window of our prattle.<br/>
<br/>
I skip and shout and sing and sigh.<br/>
Too soon, the day will have her way<br/>
And call me home away from play.<br/>
Oh! It's not my home to be...me.<br/>
<br/>
My home is this among these trees:<br/>
See this face push the roof of leaves.<br/>
Study! I climb so very high;<br/>
The lazy sun lands on my cheeks.<br/>
<br/>
My home is this broken stick of oak:<br/>
See how I swing on this mailbox.<br/>
Chingk! It screams, shamed of system'd seas;<br/>
It clangs of its machinations.<br/>
<br/>
My home is this rippled old breeze:<br/>
Feel its gliding of your guiding.<br/>
Study! The wind whispers with wont;<br/>
Unbroken phrases are spoken.<br/>
<br/>
She calls.<br/>
<br/>
Those playthings fall from my spirit.<br/>
Unlocked inside society,<br/>
They talk of Michaelangelo.<br/>
