&quot;Eat, drink, and be merry<br/>
For tomorrow you shall die&quot;<br/>
are the words I've heard<br/>
from time to time<br/>
<br/>
I sit back and wonder<br/>
if living that kind of life<br/>
would make a man dead before he dies<br/>
<br/>
For living a life of pleasure<br/>
holding no concern for tomorrow<br/>
Rips from a man what makes him liveâ€”<br/>
<br/>
His dreams<br/>
The hunger to do more<br/>
All that he loves<br/>
The life he lives<br/>
<br/>
All drowned by the wash of a drink<br/>
All forgotten by the sensual touch of destruction<br/>
Holding no regard for the day that follows<br/>
<br/>
Worldly vices leave but two marks<br/>
Pleasures lasting for a night<br/>
And hope losing its candlelight<br/>
Without hope, man surely dies<br/>
For without hope, there's no desire<br/>
For what is man, with no desire<br/>
For who we are, is what we do<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Eat, drink, and be merry<br/>
For tomorrow you shall die&quot;<br/>
are the words I've heard<br/>
from time to time<br/>
<br/>
I sit back and wonder<br/>
if living that kind of life<br/>
would make a man dead before he dies<br/>
