<div class="poetry">

The light of life evades me.<br/>
Yet there remains one dull shade.<br/>
Neither black nor white is seen.<br/>
Life is all composed of gray.<br/>
<br/>
Amid life, within gray walls,<br/>
Nameless days pass uncounted.<br/>
The promise of the morrow<br/>
Breaks as a poor yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
Moods from this gray weariness<br/>
Burden a soul heavily.<br/>
Encouragement and advice<br/>
Have no lingering effects.<br/>
<br/>
These gray skies are over me.<br/>
What is shown is what is known.<br/>
Upon this circular walk,<br/>
I walk the walk to nowhere.<br/>
