As the open road beckons,<br/>
One receives the call to flight.<br/>
Adventures of foreign lands<br/>
Tempts one with his heart's delight.<br/>
<br/>
For the contrasts of today<br/>
Are dulled by a haze of gray.<br/>
<br/>
Upon the road wanderer<br/>
These worn streets wear heavily.<br/>
For there exists no longer<br/>
Any opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
For unrequited passions<br/>
Lead to lone resolutions.<br/>
<br/>
Shall I venture to pursue<br/>
Exploration's allurement?<br/>
What roads do I take for you<br/>
To reach my heart's contentment?<br/>
<br/>
For I yearn, as pursuer,<br/>
The woman to discover.<br/>
<br/>
As the open road beckons,<br/>
One receives the call to flight.<br/>
Adventures of foreign lands<br/>
Tempts one with his heart's delight.<br/>
<br/>
