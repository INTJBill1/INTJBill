<div class="poetry">

Through corridors of the mind,<br/>
Flow entities of no form.<br/>
The shapeless has life assigned.<br/>
As it is held near and warm.<br/>
<br/>
A moment of prevalence,<br/>
Molds a roaming entity.<br/>
Inexisting existence,<br/>
All within the mind of me.<br/>
<br/>
The haze amidst life's timeline,<br/>
Shrouds the past's reality.<br/>
Is the stored scene really mind<br/>
Or <em>did</em> this fate befall me?
