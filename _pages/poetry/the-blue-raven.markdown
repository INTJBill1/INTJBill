The raven's cage was honey,<br/>
(from either one thirty-two,<br/>
or was it one thirty-three?)<br/>
Till he broke to fly to blue.<br/>
<br/>
But in his break, he mistook<br/>
The blue as the color red.<br/>
Far flung from mounts of fair look,<br/>
He flapped as one near the dead.<br/>
<br/>
Strange ways are the fallen preys<br/>
As the raven fell earthward.<br/>
For soon the blue of past Mays,<br/>
Bore the brunt of the bluebird.<br/>
<br/>
The fallen flight of fools' gain,<br/>
Left a beak to peck his wings.<br/>
In repetitions of pain,<br/>
He laments his own failings.<br/>
<br/>
For in found fruits of favor,<br/>
Its sweet succor was complete.<br/>
Yet he chose to find savor,<br/>
In that which was his conceit.<br/>
