<div class="poetry">

the images of the pilgrimages shame the lame<br/>
the load of the road weighed the frayed<br/>
the call of the fall fell the shell<br/>
the lark of the dark gave seed to tragedy<br/>
the path of the wrath turns to yearns<br/>
the mills of the hills mock the lock<br/>
the years of the fears demonized the dramatized<br/>
the lament of the absent cries of the demise<br/>
the chastised turned disenfranchised swoons for the moons<br/>
the condiments on the sacraments taste of waste<br/>
the looks into the books frown on the crown<br/>
<br/>
