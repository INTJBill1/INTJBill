<div class="poetry">

Eternity of black depth<br/>
A gaze upon the dark<br/>
Drinking the displayed death<br/>
Numbing one in the pain<br/>
<br/>
The taste of bitterness<br/>
Matches life's true flavor.<br/>
<br/>
Chaotic rippling<br/>
All from my own center.<br/>
<br/>
Emptiness of the eyes<br/>
The consuming darkness<br/>
Shades of a man once known<br/>
Black nothing held beyond<br/>
<br/>
Slow buildup of anger<br/>
As the warmth fades away...<br/>
<br/>
