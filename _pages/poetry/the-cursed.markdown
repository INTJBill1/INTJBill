<div class="poetry">

Streams of solitary rays<br/>
Push past the loosely-bound blinds.<br/>
Floating down in wakes of haze,<br/>
Light loses what the dream finds.<br/>
<br/>
Lost is that recollection<br/>
Of that which was once nearer.<br/>
Apart from his reflection,<br/>
She walks in aimless wander.<br/>
<br/>
In pursuits of plastic gains,<br/>
She hates her own destiny.<br/>
As Suns raze, the ache remains<br/>
In this false reality.<br/>
<br/>
The fire that burned in her<br/>
Was fueled by the passion's name.<br/>
The reproach of the dreamer,<br/>
Is the quenching of this flame.<br/>
<br/>
The onslaught of the evening<br/>
Fades to black the life of site.<br/>
Tormented by her dreaming,<br/>
Her heart dies another night.<br/>
