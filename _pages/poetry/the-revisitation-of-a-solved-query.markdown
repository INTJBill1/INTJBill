<div class="poetry">

Awashed with sweet emotions,<br/>
I maintain paced distances.<br/>
For undue interactions,<br/>
Lift emotional fences.<br/>
<br/>
Washed away by time's passage,<br/>
Wisdom is lost by the tide.<br/>
Through a forgotten message,<br/>
Learned lessons no longer hide.<br/>
<br/>
Wanting more, yet fearing less<br/>
Such erects a vexed spirit.<br/>
Fear of past lack of success,<br/>
Questions one's present merit.<br/>
<br/>
Despite risks that may be cast,<br/>
I hold this lone tenderness.<br/>
Am I doomed to live the past,<br/>
Pursuing this happiness?<br/>
<br/>
