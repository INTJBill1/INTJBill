Professors in suits and ties,<br/>
Stroll by in an astute gait.<br/>
A girl flashes flirting eyes,<br/>
Yet for another, I wait.<br/>
<br/>
Hurried women bustle by<br/>
Lost in their own state of mind.<br/>
Freshman who seem to be shy<br/>
Will glimmer for whom is kind.<br/>
<br/>
In the English Department,<br/>
Mornings are of the advent<br/>
Of a mutual consent.<br/>
Indifference towards all<br/>
Is the mood held prevalent. <br/>
Is this the sole sentiment<br/>
In the English Department?<br/>
<br/>
Begging for my thought's brisk touch,<br/>
Images pick and pilfer<br/>
In my mind a bit too much.<br/>
I hide these thoughts for later.<br/>
<br/>
As I watch the world go by<br/>
My awareness slips away.<br/>
Then, something catches my eye.<br/>
Beauty glides into my day!<br/>
<br/>
Filled with thoughts of yesteryear<br/>
Of places elsewhere, not here.<br/>
I gaze back, the time that I,<br/>
First saw this angel, &quot;Oh my!&quot;<br/>
Such pure beauty, big brown eyes,<br/>
Great figure, I speak no lies.<br/>
<br/>
Many stars I wished upon.<br/>
I would pray, &quot;What could be done<br/>
That this exquisite white dove,<br/>
Could solely be mine to love?&quot;<br/>
Oh how I cherished this dove,<br/>
An angel form high above.<br/>
<br/>
Oh what wants and desire!<br/>
I yearned her kiss of fire.<br/>
But she was not mine to hold<br/>
During those past days of old.<br/>
Though my heart was bought and sold<br/>
&quot;She loved other&quot; I was told.<br/>
<br/>
Coming together as friends,<br/>
Again, we exchange greetings.<br/>
With gleaming eyes and big grins,<br/>
We talk of the little things.<br/>
<br/>
Past memories, days of old:<br/>
Seesaws, slides, the monkey bars,<br/>
Dances, dating, and first cars;<br/>
Two lives to share and behold.<br/>
<br/>
Is there more to our small talk<br/>
Than just hellos and smiles?<br/>
Can it be, what we have sought<br/>
All along could be ourselves?<br/>
<br/>
Work, and times of fun and play:<br/>
Tests, teachers, big papers due,<br/>
People, pests, and &quot;How 'bout you?&quot;<br/>
We speak of a normal day.<br/>
<br/>
Is there more to our small talk<br/>
Than just hellos and smiles?<br/>
Can it be, what we have sought<br/>
All along could be ourselves?<br/>
<br/>
Fond dreams, wishes of success:<br/>
Matrimony, munchkins, health,<br/>
Diplomas, dream homes, and wealth;<br/>
Hopes of future happiness.<br/>
<br/>
Is there more to our small talk<br/>
Than just hellos and smiles?<br/>
Can it be, what we have sought<br/>
All along could be ourselves?<br/>
<br/>
Enjoying shared company,<br/>
The time flows by as swiftly<br/>
As the strong waters of the<br/>
Powerful Mississippi.<br/>
<br/>
Once again, it comes the time<br/>
Our conversation must end.<br/>
She goes her own way and I'm,<br/>
Sitting aloneâ€”once again.<br/>
