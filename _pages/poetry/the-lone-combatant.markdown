<div class="poetry">

Alone with my principles,<br/>
I choose this more somber path.<br/>
Endeavors with few morals,<br/>
Slowly fueled my inner wrath.<br/>
<br/>
Nights of drunken revelry,<br/>
Proved to reap ill consequence.<br/>
Past moments of vanity,<br/>
Hold meager significance.<br/>
<br/>
Weary of carnal mindsets,<br/>
I push for loftier gains.<br/>
Turning to face worldly threats,<br/>
I draw the line here: no more.<br/>
