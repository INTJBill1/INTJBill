<div class="poetry">

Spread wide your arms for the flight.<br/>
Cling upon the clouds of night.<br/>
Skim the treetops in delight.<br/>
Push further toward the site.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain from this deep craving<br/>
Composed of foolish raving.<br/>
For how can one keep running<br/>
To that which has no bearing?<br/>
<br/>
For more than a span of land<br/>
Proves as the distance apart.<br/>
For the voyage's demand<br/>
Consists of winning her heart.<br/>
<br/>
What can possibly be won<br/>
Where there is no victory?<br/>
For long ago it was done:<br/>
The heart's bitter destiny.<br/>
<br/>
Pursue your soul's endeavor<br/>
For answers by true intent.<br/>
You shall only discover<br/>
Your spirit's discontentment.<br/>
<br/>
Wind traveler, heed the wise:<br/>
Guard your heart from her dark eyes.<br/>
These waters of love's demise<br/>
Present hard truths to realize.<br/>
<br/>
