<div class="poetry">

What mystique surrounds the night<br/>
When the mind frolics alone!<br/>
What one sees without the light<br/>
Sums more than what can be shown.<br/>
<br/>
For a pure night frees the mind<br/>
Ensnarled by the day's stress.<br/>
Roaming amidst this bliss find,<br/>
My spirit's joy is boundless.<br/>
<br/>
The evening's breeze flows through me<br/>
Invigorating my soul.<br/>
I find inner harmony<br/>
Through the night's touch and control.<br/>
<br/>
Thought spent in contemplation,<br/>
Amongst ideas and insight,<br/>
Is the song for the motion<br/>
In this shared dance with the night.<br/>
<br/>
