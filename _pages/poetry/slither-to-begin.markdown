<div class="poetry">

silent screams in solitude<br/>
soon shackle saint and sinner.<br/>
in sounds of silent seclude,<br/>
the serpent's sting shelves summer.<br/>
<br/>
as dusk beckons for summer,<br/>
we dance in contemplation.<br/>
fueling the reign of fire<br/>
unlocks the absolution.<br/>
<br/>
In the realm of the once known,<br/>
There's the forgotten garden.<br/>
The charge unveiled the unknown<br/>
As adventure awaits men.<br/>
<br/>
Washed with singular purpose,<br/>
The path is renewed again.<br/>
No longer under the curse,<br/>
One emerges to begin.<br/>
