<div class="poetry">

Foreign travelers float past,<br/>
Each face devoid of bright cheer,<br/>
Forlorn, dark moods that are cast,<br/>
Speak longing of those held dear.<br/>
<br/>
As the travelers yearn on,<br/>
Far from their companionship,<br/>
I too, am but a lone pawn.<br/>
From life's flask, alone I sip.<br/>
<br/>
A stranger among strangers,<br/>
I find special company.<br/>
For a unique bond occurs—<br/>
Life apart: the odyssey.<br/>
<br/>
Yet hope holds no boundary,<br/>
As the birds of flight arrive.<br/>
Lone hearts now touch lovingly—<br/>
A glimpse of why I survive.<br/>
<br/>
Time and distance separate<br/>
My love for eternity.<br/>
Apart now with our own fate,<br/>
Future flight joins you and me.<br/>
<br/>
