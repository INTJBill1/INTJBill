What good is in pursuing<br/>
Potential relationships?<br/>
Leading to one's undoing<br/>
Such presents needless hardships.<br/>
<br/>
Unable to turn aside<br/>
From the bottomless tumbling,<br/>
Why does one's heart open wide,<br/>
For the spirit's battering?<br/>
<br/>
What fruits are gained in this game,<br/>
A labor of frustration?<br/>
Merely a worldly acclaimâ€”<br/>
What a joyless obsession!<br/>
<br/>
Though delved in dark emotions,<br/>
There is no alternative.<br/>
Led by the heart's suggestions,<br/>
One is rendered a captive.<br/>
