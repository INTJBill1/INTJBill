<div class="poetry">

Floating irrelevancyâ€”<br/>
Such has been the day for me.<br/>
Times of insignificance<br/>
Have a greater prominence.<br/>
<br/>
Long days of dry nothingness<br/>
Wearies one of the stillness.<br/>
Days of future will cherish<br/>
Today's moments of rubbish.<br/>
<br/>
Though day after day passes,<br/>
These days must find their closure.<br/>
With wisdom one realizes<br/>
The near taste of the future.<br/>
<br/>
