'Neath a shroud of greenery<br/>
A rock sits for ponderance.<br/>
As an island on the sea,<br/>
One sits in quiet presence.<br/>
<br/>
An ocean of forest brush<br/>
Encircles a lone island.<br/>
An expanse of ivy lush<br/>
Parts a man from life's demand.<br/>
<br/>
Fading columns of sunlight<br/>
Provide a soft ambience.<br/>
Singing songs to call the night,<br/>
Crickets fill the sea's silence.<br/>
<br/>
On this rock of reflection,<br/>
I yearn to steal a shared glance.<br/>
Gazing upon reunion,<br/>
My thoughts fall upon romance.<br/>
