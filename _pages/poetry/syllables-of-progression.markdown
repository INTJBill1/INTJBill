As I prune these vines of rhyme<br/>
In want of ripe gifts to give,<br/>
These scribed silhouettes of time<br/>
Will dim from the life I live.<br/>
<br/>
I walk the passed cityscapes<br/>
And recluse within coffee.<br/>
Days fade to blacken the shapes<br/>
In each sip of evening tea.<br/>
<br/>
As I reach life's overlook,<br/>
How can I pen this expanse?<br/>
Simple rhymes within a book<br/>
Cannot convey your substance.<br/>
<br/>
For woven in my story<br/>
Runs an invisible thread.<br/>
I play a minor party<br/>
To whom to which I am led.<br/>
<br/>
Nights of &quot;chaotic ripples&quot;<br/>
And days of &quot;canopy rock&quot;<br/>
Are poetic examples<br/>
Of your gentle, steady knock.<br/>
<br/>
Despite my &quot;carnal allure&quot;<br/>
Or despondent &quot;shades of gray,&quot;<br/>
There stands my worn soul's lover<br/>
Who shepherds along the way.<br/>
<br/>
