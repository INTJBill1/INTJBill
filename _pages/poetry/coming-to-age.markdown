<div class="poetry">

Amidst me, two paths exist:<br/>
A road of ease and control<br/>
Versus a walkway a mist.<br/>
Each travel owns its own goal.<br/>
<br/>
Many journals I've traversed,<br/>
But all have simply been one.<br/>
It's one that's been pavement-cursed,<br/>
With nothing new that's been done.<br/>
<br/>
I've followed the same wide road,<br/>
Going to and fro for years.<br/>
Compliance is my abode,<br/>
With no original fears.<br/>
<br/>
Life must be more than just this—<br/>
A world of predestiny!<br/>
With this route, what do I miss?<br/>
True love? Camaraderie?<br/>
<br/>
As I stand, there still remains—<br/>
Two paths—the worn or the lone;<br/>
One, for calculated gains,<br/>
The other, holds the unknown.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Which one?&quot; demands the query.<br/>
The road that has always been?<br/>
Or the pathway that could be?<br/>
I choose; the door is open.
