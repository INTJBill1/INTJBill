<div class="poetry">

A quandary presents:<br/>
Rays of tenderness.<br/>
<br/>
Pulling my gaze downward,<br/>
I break the rays of tenderness.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot share these thoughts.<br/>
For I fear that,<br/>
If I could share,<br/>
How would I?<br/>
How am I falling in love with a friend?<br/>
<br/>
Two hearts jaded by others.<br/>
<br/>
How I wishâ€”<br/>
Running through your hair;<br/>
Gliding along your face...<br/>
Rays of tenderness.<br/>
<br/>
Eyes catch for a moment's embrace...<br/>
<br/>
I turn aside.<br/>
