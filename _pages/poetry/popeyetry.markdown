I stumble into work—<br/>
<br/>
<em>Not that I'm tottering down the hotel hallways per se</em><br/>
<br/>
—it is more of a mental tumble.<br/>
<br/>
Each morning there is a gray frothiness<br/>
that encircles my consciousness,<br/>
a tussle between existentialism<br/>
and a chimpanzee in a blue suit.<br/>
<br/>
Caught on a string between two worlds,<br/>
I must have been dashed upon a wall on the fall.<br/>
<br/>
I dump a clump<br/>
of coffee lump<br/>
and let the narcotic prep...<br/>
<br/>
In a state of viscous stupor,<br/>
I poke at the &quot;blinkey red thingey&quot;<br/>
that pries for attention.<br/>
In our conversation,<br/>
I reply in nonsensical articulation.<br/>
<br/>
Drops of dark roast land upon my tongue;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my soul SWELLS.<br/>
<br/>
In a transformation akin to Popeye's canned cravings:<br/>
<br/>
TheRushOfAFloodOfTangentsWashOverMe.<br/>
