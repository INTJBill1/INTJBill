<div class="poetry">

What words could my lips fathom<br/>
For this silent touch in time:<br/>
A touch that alters evermore;<br/>
A touch of united hands.<br/>
<br/>
O such a touch, can it be<br/>
A mere illusion for me?<br/>
Or is life's reality<br/>
My own fulfilled fantasy?<br/>
<br/>
What songs could my lips render<br/>
To sing of this tender touch:<br/>
A touch that alters evermore;<br/>
A touch of united hearts.<br/>
<br/>
O, do I dream foolishly<br/>
Of passion with purity?<br/>
Or is truth shown tenderly<br/>
In this touch 'tween you and me?<br/>
<br/>
