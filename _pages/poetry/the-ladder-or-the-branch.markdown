The one provides the other for the one.<br/>
<br/>
The one builds up the other;<br/>
The other pays for the other.<br/>
The one supports the other;<br/>
The other supports the one.<br/>
<br/>
The one augments the other;<br/>
The other compels the one.<br/>
The one employs the other;<br/>
The other applies the one.<br/>
<br/>
The one brings down the other;<br/>
The other weakens the one.<br/>
The one directs the other;<br/>
The other directs the one.<br/>
<br/>
The one is for the other;<br/>
The other forgets the one.<br/>
The one destroys the other;<br/>
The other yearns for the one.<br/>
<br/>
The other provides the one for the other.<br/>
