<div class="poetry">

The dark mist of the unknown<br/>
transgresses my soul<br/>
forlorn moods of loneliness<br/>
visit once again<br/>
<br/>
Taking each stepâ€”each my own<br/>
the dark sky presses upon my furrowed brow<br/>
Droplets of rain stream down my downward face<br/>
Can it be that my life is shared no longer?<br/>
<br/>
<em>Will I face the world alone?<br/>
Will I take my steps in solitude?<br/>
Am I left to feel so cold?<br/>
How will I know?</em><br/>
