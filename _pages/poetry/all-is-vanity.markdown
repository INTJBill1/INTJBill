Why do we seek<br/>
What cannot be sought?<br/>
Why do we buy<br/>
What cannot be bought?<br/>
It is deplorable<br/>
So uncontrollable.<br/>
<br/>
Though the rage builds,<br/>
Soundless thunder trembles none.<br/>
It's just the soul's self-destruction.<br/>
<br/>
A lone walk into yesterday<br/>
Is a chase after the chaseless,<br/>
A dance with the wind,<br/>
A grasp that leaves one grasping.<br/>
<br/>
The regression of oppression<br/>
Is a trend of no end.<br/>
<br/>
The emotional facets of failure<br/>
Produce a panoply of perpetual pain.<br/>
<br/>
I yearn for a call<br/>
From a phone that will never ring.<br/>
<br/>
