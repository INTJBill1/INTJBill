<div class="poetry">

The fighter breathes by fighting;<br/>
A noble breathes through fighting.<br/>
<br/>
The poet sees by writing;<br/>
A reader sees through writing.<br/>
<br/>
The lover feels by loving;<br/>
A cherished feels through loving.<br/>
<br/>
Many are deemed as dreamers<br/>
Yet such is not who they are.<br/>
Fighters, poets, and lovers<br/>
Live beyond gazes afar.<br/>
<br/>
What merit can be found<br/>
In that which could have been?<br/>
