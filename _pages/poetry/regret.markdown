How could I be in error <br/>
In guessing your behavior? <br/>
I regret as a lover, <br/>
Laying eyes on your splendor. <br/>
<br/>
When our lips touched in sweet bliss,<br/>
Could my heart make a huge miss <br/>
Of what was meant by your kiss? <br/>
Were my feelings led amiss? <br/>
<br/>
So where does this leave us now? <br/>
As you put it, I’m "Your Pal." <br/>
I want more than you’ll allow. <br/>
Through my pain, I still love thou <br/>
<br/>
How could I have been so wrong <br/>
While loving you so long? <br/>
I regret feelings so strong. <br/>
Still, in your arms, I belong. <br/>
<br/>
