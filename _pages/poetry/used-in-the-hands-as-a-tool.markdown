<div class="poetry">

Fat cats of the war machines,<br/>
Map the spoils of conquest.<br/>
War chiefs bed with greedy fiends<br/>
To enslave the world's weakest.<br/>
<br/>
Deceptions of injury<br/>
Ignite the fires of pride.<br/>
Conjured lies of treachery<br/>
Fool all to push love aside.<br/>
<br/>
What good is war anyway<br/>
For politics and power?<br/>
As the fat man has his say,<br/>
The son goes six feet under.<br/>
<br/>
When the drafted blood is poured<br/>
Out onto the desert sand,<br/>
The supplied poor tastes the sword<br/>
As the rich dine on demand.<br/>
<br/>
For investment protection,<br/>
The blameless was sent to hell,<br/>
And to mark the occasion,<br/>
A jingle of thirty fell.<br/>
<br/>
Wayward and lone, I gaze out<br/>
Past the harlequin of red.<br/>
In this dark mire of doubt,<br/>
The sunrise is for the dead.<br/>
