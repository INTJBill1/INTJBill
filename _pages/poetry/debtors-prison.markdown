To purchase that which buys us,<br/>
...We're forced to work jobs we hate<br/>
To purchase that which buys us.<br/>
<br/>
Life is of desperation<br/>
Shackled in chains of franchise.<br/>
In escapes of inaction,<br/>
Gluttony decays our eyes.<br/>
<br/>
We're forced to work jobs we hate<br/>
...To purchase that which buys us,<br/>
We're forced to work jobs we hate.<br/>
<br/>
By the &quot;third&quot; of our timeline,<br/>
We numb it &quot;all&quot; through vices.<br/>
We dance before the calf's shrine<br/>
Of foul goods and services!<br/>
<br/>
To purchase that which buys us,<br/>
We drag our money's millstone<br/>
Until there is only bone.<br/>
