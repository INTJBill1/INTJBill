<div class="poetry">

Am I the sum of my parts<br/>
Or are they but some of me?<br/>
Do I just add to the arts<br/>
Sculpted as clay pottery?<br/>
<br/>
Can there be <em>some</em> of my parts<br/>
That comprise the sum of me?<br/>
Does a soul <em>live</em> in our hearts<br/>
Or is it mere fantasy?<br/>
<br/>
Am I but automation<br/>
Of enslaved thought and movement?<br/>
Does my complex emotion<br/>
Stem from chemical descent?<br/>
<br/>
Or,<br/>
Is there,<br/>
Something more?<br/>
