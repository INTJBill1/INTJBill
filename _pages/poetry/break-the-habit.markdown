<div class="poetry">

I whistle a forlorn tune,<br/>
Of a time of blue suede shoes.<br/>
Guided by the Midtown moon,<br/>
I found my street of the blues.<br/>
<br/>
Loves known in those Memphis nights<br/>
Are but lines found in one's rhyme.<br/>
Coffeehouse eyes in dim lights<br/>
Fade to back in the sublime.<br/>
<br/>
Life plays on with its new verse<br/>
As there are lyrics to learn.<br/>
Though I am forced to rehearse,<br/>
There seems little soul to earn.<br/>
<br/>
Suns pass to scripted ends;<br/>
What to be, I do not know.<br/>
Aimless upon these islands,<br/>
I long to be of ago.<br/>
<br/>
As the sun's rote descension,<br/>
I too, am locked evermore.<br/>
There can be no revision;<br/>
The sun cannot change its row.<br/>
