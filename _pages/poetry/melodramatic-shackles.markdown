Who watches this play unfold?<br/>
Oh the joy and agony.<br/>
What a movie to behold:<br/>
The theater presents me!<br/>
<br/>
Another familiar act;<br/>
Another familiar scene.<br/>
A new face, a revealed fact:<br/>
Nothing's unique, it's been seen.<br/>
<br/>
A girl entered with a burst.<br/>
Yet, the storyline is known,<br/>
For the outcome is rehearsed:<br/>
Once again, I am alone.<br/>
<br/>
Cursed to endure these cycles,<br/>
I am lost within these rhymes.<br/>
<em>Melodramatic Shackles:</em><br/>
A fruitless poem of the times.<br/>
