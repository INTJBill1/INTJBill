<div class="poetry">

Pulling through the Georgia pine,<br/>
The train cries his soulful mourn.<br/>
He struggles down that black line<br/>
Where light and love are foreign.<br/>
<br/>
Riding upon these steel rails,<br/>
It's a lonely 3am.<br/>
Fiery fortitude fails<br/>
For the dreamer within him.<br/>
<br/>
Two thousand miles away,<br/>
He's leaving himself behind.<br/>
Choosing to forget that day,<br/>
He moves from that which can bind.<br/>
