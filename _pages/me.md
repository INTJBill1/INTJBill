## Bio

I was born in Memphis and grew up in Tennessee, moving to Arizona in my mid-20s followed by a return to Memphis. In my mid-30s, I lived in Alaska until coming home to West Tennessee. 

I have had strengths in various disciplines, spanning from IT support to teaching English on a college level—BUT, before the needle turns to pretentious: I’ve sacked groceries; sold trinkets at mall science stores; wrestled a printing press; evaluated dirt and concrete; and crafted espresso!

## Lineage

Out of my four sets of great-grandparents, one set migrated from Poland from a village near the Czech border to the United States, while another set arrived from Lithuania. 

The third set of great-grandparents can trace their ancestry back to American colonists who initially settled in Virginia and the Carolinas before venturing westward to establish homes along the Mississippi River. 

As for the fourth set, which consists of my direct paternal line, I lack information about their journey before the 19th century when they settled in the area encompassing Tipton County, TN and Caruthersville, MO.
