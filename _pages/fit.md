### Dreams

Featherweight footfalls wind deeply down the canyon of a forested path, beyond the day's embers into the twilight. Lightweight legs flow into the streams of a city nightscape, past the shadows of the nocturnal.  I feel free in these encounters.

I have a reoccurring dream where I am running. I am neither running away from nor running specifically to anything. I run with an enhanced agility.  But with the sunrise, this bliss of identity fades back, as Reality storms obnoxiously and ever so extrovertly into my bedroom as a veritable huckster; this Kool-Aid Man proffering the most foul juice of Hell and then choking it down my throat in my waking moments.  I return with all of the unmeasured and jarring gait of a concrete truck. My feet are stymied by an overload from past missteps.

### *Failing Forward*: the High-Fat Carnivore (HFC) Approach

I have come to the conclusion that calories do not bear weight as to success in weightloss, that it is a game that it is all about manipulating my organ of adipose tissue. Step back and look at the big picture: yes, calorie reduction has a temporary effect, but the body responds to the scarcity by lowering metabolism. And for whatever reason, our body puts our fat at the front of the line to be served incoming calories first, even at the detriment to the rest of the body. Wild stuff, I know!

It is not that I did not give a low-calorie approach a good try! At 1150 kcal while hitting RDAs and amino acids while working out 2-4 hours a day for six days a week when I was on, calorie restriction was my overall intent from April 2018 into June 2020. But, could it resist the rollercoaster ride back up the scale? Not hardly. I found the value of keto and then carnivore. 

I became a carnivore after watching: *[The 10+ year Carnivores take on: Fasting, Salt, Organs, Electrolytes, Cheating, &amp; their Lab-Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YO4UR3LQZMU).* I found more recent value in this *[High Fat Five-Month Update from a 13-Year Carnivore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKgUPGUlxJU)*.

### The Mindset

It is all about The Hunt.  Would ancestral Bill kill squirrels all day long to eat or would he (maybe) take down a beast first thing in the morning?  He most definitely would NOT have harvested grasses to mill them, dug up roots that are poisonous, or even accessed berries beyond the couple of weeks per year.

Carbohydrates are just a lab coat's way of saying sugar.  And sugar is the devil.

## The Application

### Daily

* 200-230+ grams of animal fat
* ~75 grams of animal protein

## Ships' Manifests

Just bumbling around from Dec 31, 2017 to April 1, I went from 331 lbs to 321.  I needed something more.  And thus began *The Expeditions*.

* **LC** = Low-calorie (<1240 kcal) / 100%+ RDA's
* **K** = Keto
* **C** = General Carnivore
* **HFC** / **HFC2** = High Fat Carnivore    
fat: 200+ g; protein: <75 g; sugar: ~0 g
